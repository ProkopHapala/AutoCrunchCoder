When documenting C/C++ code using Doxygen or other similar automatic documentation tools, there are several special keywords (called "commands") that help structure and organize the documentation. These commands provide metadata and additional structure to make the documentation more useful and navigable. Here are the most commonly used and recognized Doxygen commands that you may want to include:

### 1. **File-Level Commands**
These commands are useful for describing the entire file and its purpose within a project.

- `@file` — Specifies the file being documented.
  ```cpp
  /// @file myfile.h
  ```
  
- `@brief` — Provides a short description of the file or a function.
  ```cpp
  /// @brief Short description of what this file or function does.
  ```

- `@author` — States the author(s) of the file or function.
  ```cpp
  /// @author John Doe
  ```

- `@date` — Specifies the date when the file or function was created or last modified.
  ```cpp
  /// @date September 2024
  ```

- `@version` — Provides version information for the file or project.
  ```cpp
  /// @version 1.0
  ```

### 2. **Class, Function, and Data-Level Commands**
These commands help describe classes, functions, parameters, return values, and more:

- `@param` — Describes a parameter to a function, often with its type and purpose.
  ```cpp
  /// @param[in] param1 Description of the first parameter.
  /// @param[out] param2 Description of the output parameter.
  ```

- `@return` — Describes the return value of a function.
  ```cpp
  /// @return Description of what the function returns.
  ```

- `@tparam` — For describing template parameters.
  ```cpp
  /// @tparam T Type parameter description.
  ```

- `@retval` — Describes specific return values (for enumerated return types).
  ```cpp
  /// @retval 0 Description of what a return value of 0 indicates.
  /// @retval 1 Description of what a return value of 1 indicates.
  ```

- `@throws` or `@exception` — Describes any exceptions or errors that the function might throw.
  ```cpp
  /// @throws std::invalid_argument if the input is invalid.
  ```

### 3. **Grouping and Structural Commands**
These commands are used to group related classes, files, and functions, making it easier for users to navigate large projects.

- `@addtogroup` and `@defgroup` — These commands define and add items to a group, useful for organizing related files or classes under one section.
  ```cpp
  /// @defgroup MathLibrary Mathematical Functions
  /// @addtogroup MathLibrary
  ```

- `@ingroup` — Adds a file or function to a defined group.
  ```cpp
  /// @ingroup MathLibrary
  ```

### 4. **Cross-Referencing Commands**
These commands help link related files, classes, or functions.

- `@see` — References related files, classes, or functions.
  ```cpp
  /// @see anotherFunction() for more details.
  ```

- `@link` / `@endlink` — Used to create clickable links in the documentation.
  ```cpp
  /// @link anotherFunction anotherFunction() @endlink performs a similar task.
  ```

- `@ref` — Refers to a specific section or label.
  ```cpp
  /// More details can be found in @ref sec_advanced_usage.
  ```

### 5. **Documentation Structure Enhancing Commands**
These commands enhance readability and structure.

- `@section` — Creates a section within a comment block. Useful for breaking up documentation into logical parts.
  ```cpp
  /// @section Overview
  /// This section gives an overview of the module.
  ```

- `@subsection` — Creates a subsection under a section.
  ```cpp
  /// @subsection Details
  /// Further details of the module.
  ```

- `@note` — Highlights an important note.
  ```cpp
  /// @note This function is thread-safe.
  ```

- `@warning` — Highlights a warning.
  ```cpp
  /// @warning Do not call this function in a tight loop, as it may degrade performance.
  ```

- `@todo` — Marks an area where further work is needed or a task that needs to be completed.
  ```cpp
  /// @todo Implement error handling for this function.
  ```

- `@deprecated` — Marks code as deprecated, alerting users that it will be removed in the future.
  ```cpp
  /// @deprecated This function will be removed in the next version. Use newFunction() instead.
  ```

### 6. **Detailed Descriptions and Examples**
These commands provide further explanation or examples.

- `@details` — Adds a detailed description of the file, function, or class. 
  ```cpp
  /// @details This class handles the memory management for the simulation.
  ```

- `@example` — Includes an example usage.
  ```cpp
  /// @example example.cpp
  ```

### 7. **Block-Level Commands**
These can be used for documenting blocks of code or non-function entities.

- `@code` / `@endcode` — Marks a block of code to be included in the documentation.
  ```cpp
  /// @code
  /// int a = 10;
  /// int b = 20;
  /// int sum = a + b;
  /// @endcode
  ```

- `@verbatim` / `@endverbatim` — For including verbatim text (useful for config files or scripts).
  ```cpp
  /// @verbatim
  /// This is a configuration example.
  /// key=value
  /// @endverbatim
  ```

### 8. **Inheritance and Diagram Commands**
These are useful for showing the relationships between classes.

- `@extends` — Specifies the base class that a class inherits from.
  ```cpp
  /// @extends BaseClass
  ```

- `@implements` — Specifies that a class implements an interface.
  ```cpp
  /// @implements InterfaceClass
  ```

- `@class` — Documents a class and creates inheritance diagrams.
  ```cpp
  /// @class MyClass
  ```

- `@dot` — Allows embedding dot-language diagrams for complex class hierarchies or relationships.
  ```cpp
  /// @dot
  /// digraph example {
  ///   A -> B;
  /// }
  /// @enddot
  ```

### 9. **Other Useful Tags**
- `@namespace` — Describes a namespace.
  ```cpp
  /// @namespace my_namespace
  ```

- `@struct` — Describes a struct.
  ```cpp
  /// @struct MyStruct
  ```

- `@union` — Describes a union.
  ```cpp
  /// @union MyUnion
  ```

### Conclusion

Using these commands effectively can greatly improve the readability, maintainability, and navigability of your codebase. These tags help organize documentation for both humans and tools like Doxygen or LLMs, making it easier to understand large and complex projects.

Here's an example of how to document a **class**, **namespace**, **function**, and **variable** using Doxygen-style commands, which are compatible with tools like Doxygen, Sphinx (via Breathe), and others. I’ll use the `///` comment style, as you requested.

### Example of Class, Namespace, Function, and Variable Documentation

```cpp
/// @file ExampleClass.h
/// @brief Example of how to document a class, namespace, function, and variable in C++ using Doxygen-style comments.
/// 
/// This file defines a simple class that demonstrates documentation for a class, namespace, functions, and variables. It uses standard Doxygen tags.

#include <string>

/// @namespace MathUtils
/// @brief A namespace for various mathematical utilities and helper functions.
///
/// The MathUtils namespace contains helper functions that provide mathematical calculations 
/// such as addition, subtraction, and other operations useful for a variety of applications.
namespace MathUtils {

    /// @class Calculator
    /// @brief A simple calculator class that performs basic arithmetic operations.
    ///
    /// The Calculator class provides methods for performing addition, subtraction, multiplication, 
    /// and division. It also has a history of results that can be retrieved by the user.
    class Calculator {
    private:
        /// @brief Stores the last result of a calculation.
        ///
        /// This variable holds the result of the most recent arithmetic operation performed
        /// by the calculator.
        double lastResult;

    public:
        /// @brief Constructor for the Calculator class.
        ///
        /// Initializes the lastResult variable to zero upon creating a new instance of the class.
        Calculator() : lastResult(0) {}

        /// @brief Adds two numbers together.
        /// @param[in] a The first number to be added.
        /// @param[in] b The second number to be added.
        /// @return The sum of the two input numbers.
        ///
        /// This function takes two input parameters and returns their sum.
        double add(double a, double b) {
            lastResult = a + b;
            return lastResult;
        }

        /// @brief Subtracts one number from another.
        /// @param[in] a The number from which to subtract.
        /// @param[in] b The number to subtract.
        /// @return The result of the subtraction (a - b).
        ///
        /// This function subtracts the second number from the first and stores the result in the `lastResult` variable.
        double subtract(double a, double b) {
            lastResult = a - b;
            return lastResult;
        }

        /// @brief Retrieves the last result.
        /// @return The result of the most recent calculation.
        ///
        /// This function returns the value stored in the `lastResult` variable, which holds
        /// the result of the most recent arithmetic operation.
        double getLastResult() const {
            return lastResult;
        }

        /// @brief Sets the last result manually.
        /// @param[in] result A new value for lastResult.
        ///
        /// This function allows the user to manually set the last result, which can be useful 
        /// for keeping track of results outside the normal calculator operations.
        void setLastResult(double result) {
            lastResult = result;
        }
    };

    /// @brief Performs a multiplication operation.
    /// @param[in] a The first number to multiply.
    /// @param[in] b The second number to multiply.
    /// @return The result of multiplying `a` and `b`.
    ///
    /// This is a standalone function within the MathUtils namespace that multiplies two numbers.
    double multiply(double a, double b) {
        return a * b;
    }
}
```

### Breakdown of Documentation

#### 1. **Namespace Documentation**
```cpp
/// @namespace MathUtils
/// @brief A namespace for various mathematical utilities and helper functions.
///
/// The MathUtils namespace contains helper functions that provide mathematical calculations 
/// such as addition, subtraction, and other operations useful for a variety of applications.
```
- The `@namespace` tag defines a namespace.
- The `@brief` tag gives a short description of the namespace's purpose.
- The detailed description elaborates on what utilities the namespace contains.

#### 2. **Class Documentation**
```cpp
/// @class Calculator
/// @brief A simple calculator class that performs basic arithmetic operations.
///
/// The Calculator class provides methods for performing addition, subtraction, multiplication, 
/// and division. It also has a history of results that can be retrieved by the user.
```
- The `@class` tag defines the class.
- The `@brief` tag describes the class in a few words.
- The detailed description explains its purpose and functionality in greater detail.

#### 3. **Variable Documentation**
```cpp
/// @brief Stores the last result of a calculation.
///
/// This variable holds the result of the most recent arithmetic operation performed
/// by the calculator.
double lastResult;
```
- The `@brief` tag provides a concise explanation of what the variable does.
- A more detailed description gives additional context about its use.

#### 4. **Function Documentation**
```cpp
/// @brief Adds two numbers together.
/// @param[in] a The first number to be added.
/// @param[in] b The second number to be added.
/// @return The sum of the two input numbers.
///
/// This function takes two input parameters and returns their sum.
double add(double a, double b) {
    lastResult = a + b;
    return lastResult;
}
```
- The `@brief` tag describes the function’s purpose in one sentence.
- The `@param[in]` tag describes each input parameter, specifying that it is an input.
- The `@return` tag describes the return value.
- You can provide more details about the function’s logic in a paragraph after the tags.

### Optional Additional Tags

- **`@tparam`** for documenting template parameters in template functions or classes.
- **`@throws`** to describe exceptions thrown by a function (if applicable).
- **`@note`** or **`@warning`** for special information or warnings about usage.
- **`@example`** to include usage examples if needed.

### Summary

By using these tags:
- You provide a concise overview with `@brief`.
- You describe specific details about function parameters with `@param` and return values with `@return`.
- You can also handle more advanced documentation needs like exceptions (`@throws`), templates (`@tparam`), and detailed sections using `@note` or `@example`.

This style of documentation not only makes the code easier to understand for humans but also works with tools like Doxygen to generate structured documentation automatically.


Yes, it is possible to document variables inline at the end of the line in C++ using `///` comments. This approach works well for simple variables or constants where you want to provide a brief description without interrupting the flow of the code.

### Example of Inline Variable Documentation

Here’s an example:

```cpp
class Calculator {
private:
    double lastResult;  ///< Stores the result of the most recent calculation.

public:
    int precision = 10; ///< Specifies the precision level for decimal calculations.
    const double pi = 3.14159265358979; ///< The mathematical constant pi.
};
```

### Key Points:
- **Inline documentation** is placed after the variable declaration on the same line.
- **`///<` (trailing comment)** is used to place the documentation inline. This is a common convention, especially in Doxygen.

### Benefits:
- Keeps variable documentation concise and easily accessible without breaking the flow of reading the code.
- Suitable for small variables or constants where the description is brief.

### Compatibility:
- This inline documentation style is supported by Doxygen and many other documentation engines that use similar syntax. It works well when you want to minimize visual clutter in the code but still provide important context for variables.
