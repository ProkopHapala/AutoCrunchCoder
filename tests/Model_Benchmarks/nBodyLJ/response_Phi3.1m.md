Note: This code assumes that the `Vec3d` struct has members named x, y, z for representing three-dimensional vectors. The REQ array is expected to contain parameters in a specific order (R0i, E0i, Qi) and should be properly initialized before calling this function with valid data. Error handling includes checks against invalid input values such as division by zero or self-interaction cases that are not physically meaningful but could occur due to incorrect boundary conditions or inputs. The code also assumes a constant charge for simplicity in the Coulomb force calculation, which should be adjusted based on actual use case requirements.
