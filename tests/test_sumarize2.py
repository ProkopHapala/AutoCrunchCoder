project_name="FireCore"
system_prompt=f"""
You are helful assistant and a senior programmer specializing in game development, physical simulations, and computational chemistry.
Your task is to analyze and sumarize set of markdown files summarizing C/C++ source code from the **{project_name}** project.
"""

prompt="""
### Objective:
You will create a concise shortlist of what has been implemented in each source file from description provided on input.
You should mainly extract the essence, shuch as what each class or functions does (i.e. what process/algorithm it implements, what is the purpose of the class or function).
The essence can be mostly found in the overview section at the begining and the notes section and at the end of chapter corresponing to each file.
Do not get lost in technical details.
In case any literature references are cited copy these citations to the output.
To make the output concise, quote just bare names functions without arguments.

### Process:
1. **Read the Markdown input:**
   - Review the summary that detail the structure of the source code files (e.g., classes, functions, global variables).

2. **Generate the Shortlist:**
   - For each file, provide:
     - **Classes**: List all classes defined in the file with a one-line description for each, explaining what feature, algorithm, or physical/chemical theory the class implements.
     - **Free Functions**: List all standalone (free) functions with a one-line description of what they implement or calculate.
     - **Global Variables**: List any global variables and their purpose.
   - if some cathegory (functions/classes/globals) is missing in the input, ommit it int the summary as well (in order to be concise).
   - Ensure each description is concise and describes how the class/function/variable contributes to the overall project.

Your output should follow this example:

```
## eFF.h
   * Classes:
        * `EFF` : Implements "Eletron focefield" for system of electrons and nuclei. Electron forcefield represents electrons as floating Gaussian orbitals composed of single spherical Gaussian function where both position and radius are dynamical variables. (see. http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mechmat.2015.02.008 )
   * Free Functions:
        * `mixLJ` : Mix Lenard-Jones interaction parameters of two atom-types i,j using Lorentz-Berthelot rules.
        * `getLJQ` : Calculates energy and force between two atoms using Lenard-Jones potential.
   * Global variables or constants:
        * `EFFparams` : list of electron-nuclei interaction perameters for electron-forcefiled parameters for most common chemical elements.
        * `default_EPCs_sp` : default enhanced core potential parameters for sp-type orbitals of most common chemical elements.
        * `COULOMB_CONST` : Constant for Coulomb interaction in units of [ electron volt * Angstroem ]
```

3. **Context and Purpose:**
   - When summarizing classes, functions, and variables, indicate their relevance to the projectâ€™s larger goals (physical simulations, numerical math, game development, 3D graphics, etc.).
   - Describe the functionality provided by the class/function in the context of the project, noting any specific algorithms, physical models, or utility they offer.
   - When appropriate, provide a brief explanation of the physical or mathematical concepts underlying the class/function.

4. **Contextual Terminology:**
   - Assume the code focuses on physical simulations, applied mathematics, analytical geometry, and 3D graphics.
   - You can assume that variable names and abbreviations match common terminology for these domains. For example:
     - `E`, `F`, and `v` likely represent energy, force, and velocity.
     - `r` and `l` represent radius and length, while `T` stands for time or temperature.
     - `d` likely represents a difference or derivative.
     - `L-J` refers to the **Lennard-Jones potential**, commonly used in simulations.

### Deliverables:
- Write the shortlist in the structured format outlined above.
- Ensure the descriptions are concise, providing just enough information to understand each component's role in the project.

please, sumarize following list of file descriptions:
