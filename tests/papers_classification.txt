@abstract:
 Lifting a single molecular wire off the surface with a combined frequency-modulated atomic force and tunneling microscope it is possible to monitor the evolution of both the wire configuration and the contacts simultaneously with the transport conductance experiment. In particular, critical points where individual bonds to the surface are broken and instabilities where the wire is prone to change its contact configuration can be identified in the force gradient and dissipation responses of the junction. This additional mechanical information can be used to unambiguously determine the conductance of a true molecular wire, that is, of a molecule that is contacted via a pointlike “crocodile clip” to each of the electrodes but is otherwise free.

@abstract:
 Because of the size of light-harvesting complexes and the involvement of electronic degrees of freedom, computationally these systems need to be treated with a combined quantum-classical description. To this end, Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics simulations have been employed in a quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) fashion for the ground state followed by excitation energy calculations again in a QM/MM scheme for the Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) complex. The self-consistent-charge density functional tight-binding (DFTB) method electrostatically coupled to a classical description of the environment was applied to perform the ground-state dynamics. Subsequently, long-range-corrected time-dependent DFTB calculations were performed to determine the excitation energy fluctuations of the individual bacteriochlorophyll a molecules. The spectral densities obtained using this approach show an excellent agreement with experimental findings. In addition, the fluctuating site energies and couplings were used to estimate the exciton transfer dynamics.

@abstract:
 While platinum has hitherto been the element of choice for catalysing oxygen electroreduction in acidic polymer fuel cells, tremendous progress has been reported for pyrolysed Fe-N-C materials. However, the structure of their active sites has remained elusive, delaying further advance. Here, we synthesized Fe-N-C materials quasi-free of crystallographic iron structures after argon or ammonia pyrolysis. These materials exhibit nearly identical M{\"{o}}ssbauer spectra and identical X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES) spectra, revealing the same Fe-centred moieties. However, the much higher activity and basicity of NH3-pyrolysed Fe-N-C materials demonstrates that the turnover frequency of Fe-centred moieties depends on the physico-chemical properties of the support. Following a thorough XANES analysis, the detailed structures of two FeN4 porphyrinic architectures with different O2 adsorption modes were then identified. These porphyrinic moieties are not easily integrated in graphene sheets, in contrast with Fe-centred moieties assumed hitherto for pyrolysed Fe-N-C materials. These new insights open the path to bottom-up synthesis approaches and studies on site-support interactions.

@abstract:
 A class of important semiconductors, such as Si, Ge, or C, has an indirect band gap, which critically limits their optical properties. Lack of efficient emission is especially unfortunate for silicon, where Si light sources could enable realization of the long-awaited on-chip-integrated Si laser for an integrated optical computing CPU architecture. Hence, methods toward the improvement of optical properties of Si-based materials are in high demand. Unlike most of the applied light-emitting semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs) with a direct band gap, the radiative rate in covalent silicon NCs (SiNCs) is size-dependent but remains low even for the smallest SiNCs. Additionally, the radiative rate is also ligand-sensitive, and the covalent bond with ligands is very rigid and static and could be, in principle, used for straining via steric hindrance, further influencing the radiative rates. In this work, we use the self-consistent density functional theory (DFT) simulation together with a "fuzzy"band-structure concept to show the effect of covalently bonded ligands on the electronic structure of NCs and their k - -space projection. For instance, in 2 nm large SiNCs with C-linked organic ligands, we demonstrate that radiative rates can be manipulated by ligands to a considerable extent through an intricate interplay between charge transfer from the core to the ligand, orbital delocalization, and strain by steric hindrance. We propose that the tunability of electronic properties achieved via ligands in covalent systems offers a possible direction toward the design of an ideal Si light-emitting system.

@abstract:
 Single-determinant (SD) fixed-node diffusion Monte Carlo (FNDMC) gains popularity as a benchmark method scalable to large noncovalent systems, although its accuracy limits are not yet fully mapped out. We report on an interesting example of significant SD FNDMC accuracy variations in middle-sized hydrogen-bonded dimer complexes, formic acid (FA) vs methanediol (MD), distinct by the maximum bond order (2 vs 1). While the traditional SD FNDMC schemes based on bias cancellation are capable of achieving benchmark (2{\%}) accuracy for MD, this has not been the case for FA. We identify the leading systematic error source in energy differences and show that suitably designed Jastrow factors enable SD FNDMC to reach the reference accuracy for FA. This work clearly illustrates the varying accuracy of the present-day SD FNDMC at the 0.1 kcal/mol scale for a particular set of systems but also points out promising routes toward alleviation of these shortcomings, still within the single-reference framework.

@abstract:
 Graphene-related materials are in the forefront of nanomaterial research. One of the most common ways to prepare graphenes is to oxidize graphite (natural or synthetic) to graphite oxide and exfoliate it to graphene oxide with consequent chemical reduction to chemically reduced graphene. Here, we show that both natural and synthetic graphite contain a large amount of metallic impurities that persist in the samples of graphite oxide after the oxidative treatment, and chemically reduced graphene after the chemical reduction. We demonstrate that, despite a substantial elimination during the oxidative treatment of graphite samples, a significant amount of impurities associated to the chemically reduced graphene materials still remain and alter their electrochemical properties dramatically. We propose a method for the purification of graphenes based on thermal treatment at 1,000 °C in chlorine atmosphere to reduce the effect of such impurities on the electrochemical properties. Our findings have important implications on the whole field of graphene research.

@abstract:
 This article analyzes the ability of semiempirical quantum-mechanical methods (PM6 and PM7) and self-consistent charge density-functional tight-binding (SCC-DFTB) method DFTB3 to describe halogen bonds. Calculations of the electrostatic potential on the surface of molecules containing halogens show that the $\sigma$-hole could be described well in modified neglect of diatomic overlap-based methods. The situation is more complex in the case of DFTB3 where a simpler model is used for the electrostatics, but short-ranged effects are covered in the Hamiltonian. All these methods can thus capture the effects that, for example, define the geometry of halogen bonds. The interaction energies are, however, affected by generally underestimated repulsion, which has been addressed earlier by standalone empirical corrections. Another approach to correcting this issue in DFTB3 is presented here—a modification of the energies of d-orbitals on halogens yields better results than the empirical correction in DFTB3-D3X, although it remains difficult to describe halogen and hydrogen bonds simultaneously. {\textcopyright} 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

 The control of charge transport in an active electronic device depends intimately on the modulation of the internal charge density by an external node. For example, a field-effect transistor relies on the gated electrostatic modulation of the channel charge produced by changing the relative position of the conduction and valence bands with respect to the electrodes. In molecular-scale devices, a longstanding challenge has been to create a true three-terminal device that operates in this manner (that is, by modifying orbital energy). Here we report the observation of such a solid-state molecular device, in which transport current is directly modulated by an external gate voltage. Resonance-enhanced coupling to the nearest molecular orbital is revealed by electron tunnelling spectroscopy, demonstrating direct molecular orbital gating in an electronic device. Our findings demonstrate that true molecular transistors can be created, and so enhance the prospects for molecularly engineered electronic devices.

 The surface-confined formation of bicomponent organic molecular networks providing open pores following hierarchic assembly principles is investigated by low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and ab initio theoretical methods. The nanomeshes are realized by codeposition of N,N'-diphenyl oxalic amide and sexiphenyl dicarbonitrile molecules, with the substrate held at room temperature and subsequent cooling to cryogenic temperatures. We find that the formation of mixed molecular networks is generally preferred over phase segregation. Depending on the exact stoichiometry of the constituents, different types of open networks self-assemble on the employed Ag(111) surface. All network types reflect hierarchic architectures, where essential molecular interactions are identical and the noncovalent bonding of sexiphenyl to oxalic amide molecules prevails. The different association motifs are assessed by theoretical modeling to unravel the mechanisms mediating the hierarchic organization, whereby a cooperative binding energy enhancement represents a significant factor.

 The accurate description of chemical processes often requires the use of computationally demanding methods like density-functional theory (DFT), making long simulations of large systems unfeasible. In this Letter we introduce a new kind of neural-network representation of DFT potential-energy surfaces, which provides the energy and forces as a function of all atomic positions in systems of arbitrary size and is several orders of magnitude faster than DFT. The high accuracy of the method is demonstrated for bulk silicon and compared with empirical potentials and DFT. The method is general and can be applied to all types of periodic and nonperiodic systems.

To this end the structure of 1 in the solid state and the conversion of 1 to mono- and dicationic mixed-valence complexes have been accomplished. The latter compounds have been isolated as pure materials and characterized by IR, EPR, and M{\"{o}}ssbauer spectroscopies and single-crystal XRD (monocation only) and magnetic susceptibility measurements. Near-IR spectra demonstrate the mixed valence character of the cations (valence trapped on the IR, EPR and M{\"{o}}ssbauer time scales), and the energies of the intervalence charge-transfer bands provide a measure of the hole hopping frequency.

@abstract:
 The heavens contain a variety of materials that range from conventional to extraordinary and extreme. For this colloquium, we define Astromaterial Science as the study of materials, in astronomical objects, that are qualitatively denser than materials on earth. Astromaterials can have unique properties, related to their density, such as extraordinary mechanical strength, or alternatively be organized in ways similar to more conventional materials. The study of astromaterials may suggest ways to improve terrestrial materials. Likewise, advances in the science of conventional materials may allow new insights into astromaterials. We discuss Coulomb crystals in the interior of cold white dwarfs and in the crust of neutron stars and review the limited observations of how stars freeze. We apply astromaterial science to the generation of gravitational waves. According to Einstein's Theory of General Relativity accelerating masses radiate gravitational waves. However, very strong materials may be needed to vigorously accelerate large masses in order to produce continuous gravitational waves that are observable in present detectors. We review large-scale molecular dynamics simulations of the breaking stress of neutron star crust that suggest it is the strongest material known, some ten billion times stronger than steel. Nuclear pasta is an example of a soft astromaterial. It is expected near the base of the neutron star crust at densities of ten to the fourteen grams per cubic centimeter. Competition between nuclear attraction and Coulomb repulsion rearrange neutrons and protons into complex non-spherical shapes such as flat plates (lasagna) or thin rods (spaghetti). We review semi-classical molecular dynamics simulations of nuclear pasta. We illustrate some of the shapes that are possible and discuss transport properties including shear viscosity and thermal and electrical conductivities.

@abstract:
 The development of interatomic potentials employing artificial neural networks has seen tremendous progress in recent years. While until recently the applicability of neural network potentials (NNPs) has been restricted to low-dimensional systems, this limitation has now been overcome and high-dimensional NNPs can be used in large-scale molecular dynamics simulations of thousands of atoms. NNPs are constructed by adjusting a set of parameters using data from electronic structure calculations, and in many cases energies and forces can be obtained with very high accuracy. Therefore, NNP-based simulation results are often very close to those gained by a direct application of first-principles methods. In this review, the basic methodology of high-dimensional NNPs will be presented with a special focus on the scope and the remaining limitations of this approach. The development of NNPs requires substantial computational effort as typically thousands of reference calculations are required. Still, if the problem to be studied involves very large systems or long simulation times this overhead is regained quickly. Further, the method is still limited to systems containing about three or four chemical elements due to the rapidly increasing complexity of the configuration space, although many atoms of each species can be present. Due to the ability of NNPs to describe even extremely complex atomic configurations with excellent accuracy irrespective of the nature of the atomic interactions, they represent a general and therefore widely applicable technique, e.g. for addressing problems in materials science, for investigating properties of interfaces, and for studying solvation processes.

@abstract:
 Graphene has changed from being the exclusive domain of condensed-matter physicists to being explored by those in the electron-device community. In particular, graphene-based transistors have developed rapidly and are now considered an option for post-silicon electronics. However, many details about the potential performance of graphene transistors in real applications remain unclear. Here I review the properties of graphene that are relevant to electron devices, discuss the trade-offs among these properties and examine their effects on the performance of graphene transistors in both logic and radiofrequency applications. I conclude that the excellent mobility of graphene may not, as is often assumed, be its most compelling feature from a device perspective. Rather, it may be the possibility of making devices with channels that are extremely thin that will allow graphene field-effect transistors to be scaled to shorter channel lengths and higher speeds without encountering the adverse short-channel effects that restrict the performance of existing devices. Outstanding challenges for graphene transistors include opening a sizeable and well-defined bandgap in graphene, making large-area graphene transistors that operate in the current-saturation regime and fabricating graphene nanoribbons with well-defined widths and clean edges.

@abstract:
 The surfaces of aqueous solutions are traditionally viewed as devoid of inorganic ions. Molecular simulations and surface-selective spectroscopic techniques show, however, that large polarizable anions and hydronium cations can be found (and even enhanced) at the surface and are involved in chemistry at the air/water interface. Here, we review recent studies of ions at the air/water interface and compare from this perspective water with other polar solvents. For water, we focus in particular on the surface behavior of its ionic product (i.e., hydronium and hydroxide ions). We also investigate the feasibility of dielectric models for the description of the protein/water interface, in analogy to the air/water interface. Little correlation is found between these two interfaces in terms of ion segregation. Therefore, we suggest a local model of pairing of ions from the solution with charged and polar groups at the protein surface. We also describe corresponding results of experimental studies on aqueous model systems.

 The assembly and dynamics of a hierarchical, bimolecular network of sexiphenyl dicarbonitrile and N,N'-diphenyl oxalic amide molecules on the Ag(111) surface are studied by scanning tunneling microscopy at controlled temperature. The network formation is governed by a two-step protocol involving hierarchic interactions, including a novel carbonitrile-oxalic amide bonding motif. For temperatures exceeding {\~{}}70 K, more weakly bound sexiphenyl dicarbonitrile molecules carry out one-dimensional diffusion guided by the more stable substructure of the network held together by the carbonitrile-oxalic amide bonding motif. A theoretical investigation at the ab initio level confirms the different binding energies of the two coupling motifs and rationalizes the network formation and the diffusion pathway.

@abstract:
 Charge equilibration (Qeq) methods can estimate the electrostatic potential of molecules and periodic frameworks by assigning point charges to each atom, using only a small fraction of the resources needed to compute density functional (DFT)-derived charges. This makes possible, for example, the computational screening of thousands of microporous structures to assess their performance for the adsorption of polar molecules. Recently, different variants of the original Qeq scheme were proposed to improve the quality of the computed point charges. One focus of this research was to improve the gas adsorption predictions in metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), for which many different structures are available. In this work, we review the evolution of the method from the original Qeq scheme, understanding the role of the different modifications on the final output. We evaluated the result of combining different protocols and set of parameters, by comparing the Qeq charges with high quality DFT-derived DDEC charges for 2338 MOF structures. We focused on the systematic errors that are attributable to specific atom types to quantify the final precision that one can expect from Qeq methods in the context of gas adsorption where the electrostatic potential plays a significant role, namely, CO 2 and H 2 S adsorption. In conclusion, both the type of algorithm and the input parameters have a large impact on the resulting charges, and we draw some guidelines to help the user to choose the proper combination of the two for obtaining a meaningful set of charges. We show that, considering this set of MOFs, the accuracy of the original Qeq scheme is often still comparable with the most recent variants, even if it clearly fails in the presence of certain atom types, such as alkali metals.

 Ultrafast lasers are versatile tools used in many scientific areas, from welding to eye surgery. They are also used to coherently manipulate light-matter interactions such as chemical reactions, but so far control experiments have concentrated on cleavage or rearrangement of existing molecular bonds. Here we demonstrate the synthesis of several molecular species starting from small reactant molecules in laser-induced catalytic surface reactions, and even the increase of the relative reaction efficiency by feedback-optimized laser pulses. We show that the control mechanism is nontrivial and sensitive to the relative proportion of the reactants. The control experiments open up a pathway towards photocatalysis and are relevant for research in physics, chemistry, and biology where light-induced bond formation is important.

@abstract:
 For electron or hole transfer between neighboring conducting polymer strands or oligomers, the intrinsic charge-transfer rate is dictated by the charge-resonance integral and by the reorganization energy due to geometric relaxation. To explain conduction anisotropy and other solid-state effects, a multivariate, systematic analysis of bandwidth as a function of intermolecular orientations is undertaken for a series of oligoheterocycles, using first-principles methods. While cofacial oligomers show the greatest bandwidths at a given intermolecular C-C contact distance, for a fixed center-to-center intermolecular distance, tilted pi-stacking increases pi-overlap (particularly for LUMO orbitals) and decreases electrostatic repulsion, yielding optimum tilt angles for packing of approximately 40-60 degrees at small intermolecular separations. The calculations also reveal that bandwidths and intrinsic mobilities of holes and electrons in conjugated oligoheterocycles can be quite comparable.

@abstract:
 Hydrogen bonds are a complex interplay between different energy components, and their nature is still subject of an ongoing debate. In this minireview, we therefore provide an overview of the different perspectives on hydrogen bonding. This will be done by discussing the following individual energy components: 1) electrostatic interactions, 2) charge‐transfer interactions, 3) $\pi$‐resonance assistance, 4) steric repulsion, 5) cooperative effects, 6) dispersion interactions and 7) secondary electrostatic interactions. We demonstrate how these energetic factors are essential in a correct description of the hydrogen bond, and discuss several examples of systems whose energetic and geometrical features are not captured by easy‐to‐use predictive models.

@abstract:
 The nature and control of individual metal atoms on insulators are of great importance in emerging atomic-scale technologies. Individual gold atoms on an ultrathin insulating sodium chloride film supported by a copper surface exhibit two different charge states, which are stabilized by the large ionic polarizability of the film. The charge state and associated physical and chemical properties such as diffusion can be controlled by adding or removing a single electron to or from the adatom with a scanning tunneling microscope tip. The simple physical mechanism behind the charge bistability in this case suggests that this is a common phenomenon for adsorbates on polar insulating films.

@url:      http://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevB.23.5048
@abstract:
 The exact density functional for the ground-state energy is strictly self-interaction-free (i.e., orbitals demonstrably do not self-interact), but many approximations to it, including the local-spin-density (LSD) approximation for exchange and correlation, are not. We present two related methods for the self-interaction correction (SIC) of any density functional for the energy; correction of the self-consistent one-electron potenial follows naturally from the variational principle. Both methods are sanctioned by the Hohenberg-Kohn theorem, Although the first method introduces an orbital-dependent single-particle potential, the second involves a local potential as in the Kohn-Sham scheme. We apply the first method to LSD and show that it properly conserves the number content of the exchangecorrelation hole, while substantially improving the description of its shape. We apply this method to a number of physical problems, where the uncorrected LSD approach produces systematic errors. We find systematic improvements, qualitative as well as quantitative, from this simple correction. Benefits of SIC in atomic calculations include (i) improved values for the total energy and for the separate exchange and correlation pieces of it, (ii) accurate binding energies of negative ions, which are wrongly unstable in LSD, (iii) more accurate electron densities, (iv) orbital eigenvalues that closely approximate physical removal energies, including relaxation, and (v) correct longrange behavior of the potential and density, It appears that SIC can also remedy the LSD underestimate of the band gaps in insulators (as shown by numerical calculations for the rare-gas solids and CuCl), and the LSD overestimate of the cohesive energies of transition metals. The LSD spin splitting in atomic Ni and s-d interconfigurational energies of transition elements are almost unchanged by SIC. We also discuss the admissibility of fractional occupation numbers, and present a parametrization of the electron-gas correlation energy at any density, based on the recent results of Ceperley and Alder.

@abstract:
 Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations study the movement of particles over time, and have become a fundamental tool in biomedical and materials research. The accuracy of a MD simulation depends on its ability to model the physics of the chosen system, a capacity that arises from the parameters used to model the interactions between atoms (also known as a “force field”). The functional form of most force fields is an approximation of real word physics to allow for tractable simulation; one common simplification is to model the dynamic distribution of electrons around an atom as single, static, fixed partial charge. Electrostatic interactions between non-bonded atoms can then be simplified to pairwise interactions between the partial charges. PsiRESP is a Python package that uses the Psi4 quantum chemistry engine to calculate atomic partial charges. It supports multiple methods, each based on the electrostatic potential experienced at particular grid points around the molecule. These partial charges can then be used in MD simulations

@abstract:
 Davidson algorithm is a subspace iterative diagonalization method, which ap- pends to the subspace with modified (preconditioned) residue vectors during the it- eration process, in contrast to Krylov space methods. In this report, different views of understanding Davidson-type methods are reviewed, and a variety of ways of gen- erating the new expansion vector are implemented in Matlab and their performances compared. It is observed that the original Davidson method converges fast for diago- nally dominant matrices, but relatively slow otherwise, which could be fixed to some extent by using modified methods. A “quasi-realistic” problem, the diagonalization of the Hamiltonian of a planewave-pseudopotential based electronic structure calcu- lation, is solved using Davidson methods, and the result is compared with the other mainstream algorithm, preconditioned non-linear Conjugate Gradient (CG) method.

@abstract:
 The General AMBER Force Field (GAFF) has been broadly used by researchers all over the world to perform in silico simulations and modelings on diverse scientific topics, especially in the field of computer-aided drug design whose primary task is to accurately predict the affinity and selectivity of receptor-ligand binding. The atomic partial charges in GAFF and the second generation of GAFF (GAFF2) were originally developed with the quantum mechanics derived restrained electrostatic potential charge, but in practice, users usually adopt an efficient charge method, Austin Model 1-bond charge corrections (AM1-BCC), based on which, without expensive ab initio calculations, the atomic charges could be efficiently and conveniently obtained with the ANTECHAMBER module implemented in the AMBER software package. In this work, we developed a new set of BCC parameters specifically for GAFF2 using 442 neutral organic solutes covering diverse functional groups in aqueous solution. Compared to the original BCC parameter set, the new parameter set significantly reduced the mean unsigned error (MUE) of hydration free energies from 1.03 kcal/mol to 0.37 kcal/mol. More excitingly, this new AM1-BCC model also showed excellent performance in the solvation free energy (SFE) calculation on diverse solutes in various organic solvents across a range of different dielectric constants. In this large-scale test with totally 895 neutral organic solvent-solute systems, the new parameter set led to accurate SFE predictions with the MUE and the root-mean-square-error of 0.51 kcal/mol and 0.65 kcal/mol, respectively. This newly developed charge model, ABCG2, paved a promising path for the next generation GAFF development.

@abstract:
 The application of novel technologies to silicon electronics has been intensively studied with a view to overcoming the physical limitations of Moore's law, that is, the observation that the number of components on integrated chips tends to double every two years. For example, silicon devices have enormous potential for photonic integrated circuits on chips compatible with complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor devices, with various key elements having been demonstrated in the past decade. In particular, a focus on the exploitation of the Raman effect has added active optical functionality to pure silicon, culminating in the realization of a continuous-wave all-silicon laser. This achievement is an important step towards silicon photonics, but the desired miniaturization to micrometre dimensions and the reduction of the threshold for laser action to microwatt powers have yet to be achieved: such lasers remain limited to centimetre-sized cavities with thresholds higher than 20 milliwatts, even with the assistance of reverse-biased p-i-n diodes. Here we demonstrate a continuous-wave Raman silicon laser using a photonic-crystal, high-quality-factor nanocavity without any p-i-n diodes, yielding a device with a cavity size of less than 10 micrometres and an unprecedentedly low lasing threshold of 1 microwatt. Our nanocavity design exploits the principle that the strength of light-matter interactions is proportional to the ratio of quality factor to the cavity volume and allows drastic enhancement of the Raman gain beyond that predicted theoretically. Such a device may make it possible to construct practical silicon lasers and amplifiers for large-scale integration in photonic circuits.

@abstract:
 Molecular junctions have been characterized to determine the influence of the metal contact formation in the electron transport process through a single molecule. With inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy and first-principles calculations, the vibration modes of a carbon monoxide molecule have been surveyed as a function of the distance from a copper electrode with unprecedented accuracy. We observe a continuous but nonlinear blue shift of the frustrated rotation mode in tunneling with decreasing distance followed by an abrupt softening upon contact formation. This indicates that the presence of the metal electrode sensibly alters the structural and conductive properties of the junction even without the formation of a strong chemical bond.

@abstract:
 The article examines the requirement of moral certitude in a judicial decision in canon law according to canon 1608 of the Code of Canon Law of 1983. It opens with the Papal Allocutions of Pope Pius XII and Pope John Paul II. It analyses and comments on canon 1608 which rules moral certitude as a principle of the canonical sentence. It consequently examines various aspects of the process of reaching moral certitude, especially the process of collecting and evaluating the proofs, the right of defense of the parties to the process, and the obligation of the judge to appraise the proofs according to the judge's own conscience. Finally, it concludes that the way to reach a sentence based on moral certitude is quite specific, corresponding to human decision-making before God, and at the same time, is a principle of decision-making in the context of human reason, freedom and responsibility. Moral certitude does not exclude any possibility of judicial error but does exclude every serious and positive doubt about the matter to be decided by the sentence.

@abstract:
 The ability of DNA to self-assemble into one-, two- and three-dimensional nanostructures, combined with the precision that is now possible when positioning nanoparticles or proteins on DNA scaffolds, provide a promising approach for the self-organization of composite nanostructures. Predicting and controlling the functions that emerge in self-organized biomolecular nanostructures is a major challenge in systems biology, and although a number of innovative examples have been reported, the emergent properties of systems in which enzymes are coupled together have not been fully explored. Here, we report the self-assembly of a DNA scaffold made of DNA strips that include 'hinges' to which biomolecules can be tethered. We attach either two enzymes or a cofactor-enzyme pair to the scaffold, and show that enzyme cascades or cofactor-mediated biocatalysis can proceed effectively; similar processes are not observed in diffusion-controlled homogeneous mixtures of the same components. Furthermore, because the relative position of the two enzymes or the cofactor-enzyme pair is determined by the topology of the DNA scaffold, it is possible to control the reactivity of the system through the design of the individual DNA strips. This method could lead to the self-organization of complex multi-enzyme cascades.

 Learning from data has led to paradigm shifts in a multitude of disciplines, including web, text and image search, speech recognition, as well as bioinformatics. Can machine learning enable similar breakthroughs in understanding quantum many-body systems? Here we develop an efficient deep learning approach that enables spatially and chemically resolved insights into quantum-mechanical observables of molecular systems. We unify concepts from many-body Hamiltonians with purpose-designed deep tensor neural networks, which leads to size-extensive and uniformly accurate (1 kcal mol -1) predictions in compositional and configurational chemical space for molecules of intermediate size. As an example of chemical relevance, the model reveals a classification of aromatic rings with respect to their stability. Further applications of our model for predicting atomic energies and local chemical potentials in molecules, reliable isomer energies, and molecules with peculiar electronic structure demonstrate the potential of machine learning for revealing insights into complex quantum-chemical systems.

@abstract:
 Neural networks offer an unbiased and numerically very accurate approach to represent high-dimensional ab initio potential-energy surfaces. Once constructed, neural network potentials can provide the energies and forces many orders of magnitude faster than electronic structure calculations, and thus enable molecular dynamics simulations of large systems. However, Cartesian coordinates are not a good choice to represent the atomic positions, and a transformation to symmetry functions is required. Using simple benchmark systems, the properties of several types of symmetry functions suitable for the construction of high-dimensional neural network potential-energy surfaces are discussed in detail. The symmetry functions are general and can be applied to all types of systems such as molecules, crystalline and amorphous solids, and liquids.

@abstract:
 Semi-empirical quantum chemical approaches are known to compromise accuracy for the feasibility of calculations on huge molecules. However, the need for ultrafast calculations in interactive quantum mechanical studies, high-throughput virtual screening, and data-driven machine learning has shifted the emphasis toward calculation runtimes recently. This comes with new constraints for the software implementation as many fast calculations would suffer from a large overhead of the manual setup and other procedures that are comparatively fast when studying a single molecular structure, but which become prohibitively slow for high-throughput demands. In this work, we discuss the effect of various well-established semi-empirical approximations on calculation speed and relate this to data transfer rates from the raw-data source computer to the results of the visualization front end. For the former, we consider desktop computers, local high performance computing, and remote cloud services in order to elucidate the effect on interactive calculations, for web and cloud interfaces in local applications, and in world-wide interactive virtual sessions. The models discussed in this work have been implemented into our open-source software SCINE Sparrow.

 The strong spatial confinement of a nanocavity plasmonic field has made it possible to visualize the inner structure of a single molecule and even to distinguish its vibrational modes in real space. With such ever-improved spatial resolution, it is anticipated that full vibrational imaging of a molecule could be achieved to reveal molecular structural details. Here we demonstrate full Raman images of individual vibrational modes at the {\aa}ngstr{\"{o}}m level for a single Mg-porphine molecule, revealing distinct characteristics of each vibrational mode in real space. Furthermore, by exploiting the underlying interference effect and Raman fingerprint database, we propose a new methodology for structural determination, which we have called ‘scanning Raman picoscopy', to show how such ultrahigh-resolution spectromicroscopic vibrational images can be used to visually assemble the chemical structure of a single molecule through a simple Lego-like building process.

@abstract:
 A computational approach is essential whenever the complexity of the process under study is such that direct theoretical or experimental approaches are not viable. This is the case for protein folding, for which a significant amount of data are being collected. This paper reports on the essential role of in silico methods and the unprecedented interplay of computational and theoretical approaches, which is a defining point of the interdisciplinary investigations of the protein folding process. Besides giving an overview of the available computational methods and tools, we argue that computation plays not merely an ancillary role but has a more constructive function in that computational work may precede theory and experiments. More precisely, computation can provide the primary conceptual clues to inspire subsequent theoretical and experimental work even in a case where no preexisting evidence or theoretical frameworks are available. This is cogently manifested in the application of machine learning methods to come to grips with the folding dynamics. These close relationships suggested complementing the review of computational methods within the appropriate theoretical context to provide a self-contained outlook of the basic concepts that have converged into a unified description of folding and have grown in a synergic relationship with their computational counterpart. Finally, the advantages and limitations of current computational methodologies are discussed to show how the smart analysis of large amounts of data and the development of more effective algorithms can improve our understanding of protein folding.

@abstract:
 Using scanning probe microscopy techniques, at low temperatures and in ultrahigh vacuum, individual molecules adsorbed on surfaces can be probed with ultrahigh resolution to determine their structure and details of their conformation, configuration, charge states, aromaticity, and the contributions of resonance structures. Functionalizing the tip of an atomic force microscope with a CO molecule enabled atomic-resolution imaging of single molecules, and measurement of their adsorption geometry and bond-order relations. In addition, by using scanning tunneling microscopy and Kelvin probe force microscopy, the density of the molecular frontier orbitals and the electric charge distribution within molecules can be mapped. Combining these techniques yields a high-resolution tool for the identification and characterization of individual molecules. The single-molecule sensitivity and the possibility of atom manipulation to induce chemical reactions with the tip of the microscope open up unique applications in chemistry, and differentiate scanning probe microscopy from conventional methods for molecular structure elucidation. Besides being an aid for challenging cases in natural product identification, atomic force microscopy has been shown to be a powerful tool for the investigation of on-surface reactions and the characterization of radicals and molecular mixtures. Herein we review the progress that high-resolution scanning probe microscopy with functionalized tips has made for molecular structure identification and characterization, and discuss the challenges it will face in the years to come.

@title:    An electron force field for simulating large scale excited electron dynamics
@author:   Su, Julius Tsu-li
@url:      http://thesis.library.caltech.edu/1598/
@abstract:
 We introduce an electron force field (eFF) that makes simulation of large scale excited electron dynamics possible and practical. The forces acting on thousands of electrons and nuclei can be computed in less than a second on a single modern processor. Just as conventional force fields parameterize the ground state potential between nuclei, with electrons implicitly included, electron force fields parameterize the potential between nuclei and simplified electrons, with more detailed degrees of freedom implicitly included. The electrons in an electron force field are Gaussian wave packets whose only parameters are its position and its size. Using a simple version of the electron force field, we compute the dissociation and ionization behavior of dense hydrogen, and obtain equations of state and shock Hugoniot curves that are in agreement with results obtained from vastly more expensive path integral Monte Carlo methods. We also compute the Auger dissociation of hydrocarbons, and observe core hole decays, valence electron ionizations, and nuclear fragmentation patterns consistent with experiment. We show we can describe p-like valence electrons using spherical Gaussian functions, enabling us to compute accurate ionization potentials and polarizabilities for first row atoms, and accurate dissociation energies and geometries of atom hydrides and hydrocarbons. We show also that we can describe delocalized electrons in a uniform electron gas using localized eFF orbitals. We reproduce the energy of a uniform electron gas, including correlation effects; and following the historical development of density functional theory, we develop a preliminary eFF that can compute accurate exchange and correlation energies of atoms and simple molecules.

@abstract:
 Semiempirical (SE) methods can be derived from either Hartree-Fock or density functional theory by applying systematic approximations, leading to efficient computational schemes that are several orders of magnitude faster than ab initio calculations. Such numerical efficiency, in combination with modern computational facilities and linear scaling algorithms, allows application of SE methods to very large molecular systems with extensive conformational sampling. To reliably model the structure, dynamics, and reactivity of biological and other soft matter systems, however, good accuracy for the description of noncovalent interactions is required. In this review, we analyze popular SE approaches in terms of their ability to model noncovalent interactions, especially in the context of describing biomolecules, water solution, and organic materials. We discuss the most significant errors and proposed correction schemes, and we review their performance using standard test sets of molecular systems for quantum chemical methods and several recent applications. The general goal is to highlight both the value and limitations of SE methods and stimulate further developments that allow them to effectively complement ab initio methods in the analysis of complex molecular systems.

@abstract:
 The fundamental importance of water for many chemical processes has motivated the development of countless efficient but approximate water potentials for large-scale molecular dynamics simulations, from simple empirical force fields to very sophisticated flexible water models. Accurate and generally applicable water potentials should fulfill a number of requirements. They should have a quality close to quantum chemical methods, they should explicitly depend on all degrees of freedom including all relevant many-body interactions and they should be able to describe molecular dissociation and recombination. In this work, we present a high-dimensional neural network (NN) potential for water clusters based on density-functional theory (DFT) calculations, which is constructed using clusters containing up to ten monomers and is in principle able to meet all these requirements. We investigate the reliability of specific parametrizations employing two frequently used GGA exchange-correlation functionals, PBE and RPBE, as reference methods. We find that the binding energy errors of the NN potentials with respect to DFT are significantly lower than the typical uncertainties of DFT calculations arising from the choice of the exchange-correlation functional. Further, we examine the role of van der Waals interactions, which are not properly described by GGA functionals. Specifically, we incorporate the D3 scheme suggested by Grimme (J. Chem. Phys. 2010, 132, 154104) in our potentials and demonstrate that it can be applied to GGA-based NN potentials in the same way as to DFT calculations without modification. Our results show that the description of small water clusters provided by the RPBE functional is significantly improved if van der Waals interactions are included, while in case of the PBE functional, which is well-known to yield stronger binding than RPBE, van der Waals corrections lead to overestimated binding energies.

@abstract:
 Transport of electrons in a single molecule junction is the simplest$\backslash$nproblem in the general subject area of molecular electronics. In$\backslash$nthe past few years, this area has been extended to probe beyond the$\backslash$nsimple tunnelling associated with large energy gaps between electrode$\backslash$nFermi level and molecular levels, to deal with smaller gaps, with$\backslash$nnear- resonance tunnelling and, particularly, with effects due to$\backslash$ninteraction of electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom. This$\backslash$noverview is devoted to the theoretical and computational approaches$\backslash$nthat have been taken to understanding transport in molecular junctions$\backslash$nwhen these vibronic interactions are involved. After a short experimental$\backslash$noverview, and discussion of different test beds and measurements,$\backslash$nwe define a particular microscopicmodel Hamiltonian. That overall$\backslash$nHamiltonian can be used to discuss all of the phenomena dealt with$\backslash$nsubsequently. These include transition from coherent to incoherent$\backslash$ntransport as electron/ vibration interaction increases in strength,$\backslash$ninelastic electron tunnelling spectroscopy and its interpretation$\backslash$nand measurement, affects of interelectronic repulsion treated at$\backslash$nthe Hubbard level, noise in molecular transport junctions, non- linear$\backslash$nconductance phenomena, heating and heat conduction in molecular transport$\backslash$njunctions and current- induced chemical reactions. In each of these$\backslash$nareas, we use the same simple model Hamiltonian to analyse energetics$\backslash$nand dynamics. While this overview does not attempt survey the literature$\backslash$nexhaustively, it does provide appropriate references to the current$\backslash$nliterature ( both experimental and theoretical). We also attempt$\backslash$nto point out directions in which further research is required to$\backslash$nanswer cardinal questions concerning the behaviour and understanding$\backslash$nof vibrational effects in molecular transport junctions.

@abstract:
 Locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) is the basis of many algorithms that use a probabilistic approach to find nearest neighbors.We describe an algorithmfor optimizing the parameters and use of LSH. Prior work ignores these issues or suggests a search for the best parameters. We start with two histograms: one that characterizes the distributions of dis- tances to a point's nearest neighbors and the second that characterizes the distance between a query and any point in the data set. Given a desired performance level (the chance of finding the true nearest neighbor) and a simple computational cost model, we return the LSH parameters that allow an LSH index to meet the performance goal and have the minimum computational cost. We can also use this analysis to connect LSH to deterministic nearest-neighbor algorithms such as k-d trees and thus start to unify the two approaches. KEYWORDS

 We present an efficient scheme for parametrizing complex molecule–surface force fields from ab initio data. The cost of producing a sufficient fitting library is mitigated using a 2D periodic embedded slab model made possible by the quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics scheme in CP2K. These results were then used in conjunction with genetic algorithm (GA) methods to optimize the large parameter sets needed to describe such systems. The derived potentials are able to well reproduce adsorption geometries and adsorption energies calculated using density functional theory. Finally, we discuss the challenges in creating a sufficient fitting library, determining whether or not the GA optimization has completed, and the transferability of such force fields to similar molecules. {\textcopyright} 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

@abstract:
 The novel polymer poly[p-(2,5-dihydroxy)-phenylenebenzobisoxazole] (PBOH) fiber was synthesized in the presence of 2,5-dihydroxyterephthalicacid (DHTA) and 4,6-diamino-1,3-benzenediol in poly(phosphoric acid) (PPA) using typical polycondensation conditions. The crystalline solutions of liquid PBOH in PPA were spun into fibers using dry-jet wet spinning. Furthermore, the thermostability and mechanical properties of PBOH were compared with poly(p-phenylene-2,6-benzoxazole) (PBO) in order to investigate the relationship between the chain structure and properties. The results indicated that the thermal degradation temperature of PBOH was above 750K and the tensile strength of the PBOH fiber was 3.1GPa, which were much lower than those of PBO fiber. The compressive strength of PBOH fiber was 331 M Pa, which was slightly higher than that of PBO fiber. In addition, molecular simulation was employed to explain why the compressive strength of PBOH fiber did not increase significantly compared to PBO fiber.

@abstract:
 We present a fast, fully parameterizable GPU implementation of Convolutional Neural Network variants. Our feature extractors are neither carefully designed nor pre-wired, but rather learned in a supervised way. Our deep hierarchical architectures achieve the best published results on benchmarks for object classification (NORB, CIFAR10) and handwritten digit recognition (MNIST), with error rates of 2.53{\%}, 19.51{\%}, 0.35{\%}, respectively. Deep nets trained by simple back-propagation perform better than more shallow ones. Learning is surprisingly rapid. NORB is completely trained within five epochs. Test error rates on MNIST drop to 2.42{\%}, 0.97{\%} and 0.48{\%} after 1, 3 and 17 epochs, respectively.

 All elementary steps of a chemical reaction have been successfully induced on individual molecules with a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) in a controlled step-by-step manner utilizing a variety of manipulation techniques. The reaction steps involve the separation of iodine from iodobenzene by using tunneling electrons, bringing together two resultant phenyls mechanically by lateral manipulation and, finally, their chemical association to form a biphenyl molecule mediated by excitation with tunneling electrons. The procedures presented here constitute an important step towards the assembly of individual molecules out of simple building blocks in situ on the atomic scale.

@abstract:
 We explore co-deposition of water and 4, 4′-dihydroxy azobenzene on Ag(111) by low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy at different water-to-azobenzene ratios. At all ratios, the water interacts with the hydroxyl end groups of the molecule replacing the direct hydrogen bonding. The change in bonding reduces the azobenzene density as compared to the one in the closed-packed waterless azobenzene structure. At intermediate water-to-azobenzene ratios, pores are formed in the azobenzene layer at nanometer distance from the water. At high water-to-azobenzene ratios, a water superstructure with a 1.4 nm × 1.4 nm unit cell develops. Our results point to a method to vary the density of an organic layer by tuning the amount of an inorganic additive.

 Organic–organic heterojunctions (OOHs) are critical features in organic light-emitting diodes, ambipolar organic field-effect transistors and organic solar cells, which are fundamental building blocks in low-cost, large-scale, and flexible electronics. Due to the highly anisotropic nature of $\pi$-conjugated molecules, the molecular orientation of organic thin films can significantly affect the device performance, such as light absorption and charge-carrier transport, as well as the energy level alignment at OOH interfaces. This Feature Article highlights recent progress in the understanding of interface energetics at small molecule OOH interfaces, focusing on the characterization and fabrication of OOH with well-defined molecular orientations using a combination of in situ low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy, synchrotron-based high-resolution ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy and near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure measurements. The orientation dependent energy level alignments at the OOH interfaces will be discussed in detail.

 We investigated insulating Cu{\$}{\_}2{\$}N islands grown on Cu(100) by means of combined scanning tunneling microscopy and atomic force microscopy with two vastly different tips: a bare metal tip and a CO-terminated tip. We use scanning tunneling microscopy data as proposed by Choi et al. [T. Choi et al., PRB 78, 035430 (2008).] to unambiguously identify atomic positions. Atomic force microscopy images taken with the two different tips show an inverted contrast over Cu{\$}{\_}2{\$}N. The observed force contrast can be explained with an electrostatic model, where the two tips have dipole moments of opposite directions. This highlights the importance of short-range electrostatic forces in the formation of atomic contrast on polar surfaces in non-contact atomic force microscopy.

@abstract:
 Both elastic modulus and fracture stress are known to increase with the amount of mineral deposited within collagen fibrils. Current mechanical models of mineralized fibrils, where mineral platelets are arranged in parallel arrays, reproduce the first effect but fail to predict an increase in fracture stress. Here, we propose a model with a staggered array of platelets that is in better agreement with results on molecular packing in collagen fibrils and that accounts for an increase of both elastic modulus and fracture stress with the amount of mineral in the fibril. Finally, we explore the dependence of the mechanical properties within the model, when the degree of mineralization and the thickness of the platelets as well as their distance varies.

 Hydrogen bonds are the path through which protons and hydrogen atoms can be transferred between molecules. The relay mechanism, in which H-atom transfer occurs in a sequential fashion along hydrogen bonds, plays an essential role in many functional compounds. Here we use the scanning tunnelling microscope to construct and operate a test-bed for real-space observation of H-atom relay reactions at a single-molecule level. We demonstrate that the transfer of H-atoms along hydrogen-bonded chains assembled on a Cu(110) surface is controllable and reversible, and is triggered by excitation of molecular vibrations induced by inelastic tunnelling electrons. The experimental findings are rationalized by ab initio calculations for adsorption geometry, active vibrational modes and reaction pathway, to reach a detailed microscopic picture of the elementary processes.

@doi:      10.1021/ja074456t

@abstract:
 The stability and breakdown mechanism of a single molecule covalently bound to two Au electrodes via Au-S bonds were studied at room temperature. The distance over which a molecular junction can be stretched before breakdown was measured using a scanning tunneling microscopy break junction approach as a function of stretching rate. At low stretching rates, the stretching distance is small and independent of stretching rate. Above a certain stretching rate, it increases linearly with the logarithm of stretching rate. At very high stretching rates, the stretching distance reaches another plateau and becomes insensitive to the stretching rate again. The three regimes are well described by a thermodynamic bond-breaking model. A comparative study of Au-Au atomic point contacts indicates that the breakdown of the molecular junctions takes place at Au-Au bonds near the molecule-electrode contact. By fitting the experimental data with the model, the lifetime and binding energy were extracted. Both quantities are found to have broad distributions, owing to large variations in the molecule-electrode contact geometry. Although the molecular junctions are short-lived on average, certain contact geometries are considerably more stable. Several types of stochastic fluctuations were observed in the conductance of the molecule junctions, which are attributed to the atomic level rearrangement of the contact geometry, and bond breakdown and reformation processes. The possibility of bond reformation increases the apparent lifetime of the molecular junctions.

@abstract:
 Structural materials in nature exhibit remarkable designs with building blocks, often hierarchically arranged from the nanometer to the macroscopic length scales. We report on the structural properties of biosilica observed in the hexactinellid sponge Euplectella sp. Consolidated, nanometer-scaled silica spheres are arranged in well-defined microscopic concentric rings glued together by organic matrix to form laminated spicules. The assembly of these spicules into bundles, effected by the laminated silica-based cement, results in the formation of a macroscopic cylindrical square-lattice cagelike structure reinforced by diagonal ridges. The ensuing design overcomes the brittleness of its constituent material, glass, and shows outstanding mechanical rigidity and stability. The mechanical benefits of each of seven identified hierarchical levels and their comparison with common mechanical engineering strategies are discussed.

@abstract:
 Fish, reptiles, and mammals can possess flexible dermal armor for protection. Here we seek to find the means by which Nature derives its protection by examining the scales from several fish (Atractosteus spatula, Arapaima gigas, Polypterus senegalus, Morone saxatilis, Cyprinius carpio), and osteoderms from armadillos, alligators, and leatherback turtles. Dermal armor has clearly been developed by convergent evolution in these different species. In general, it has a hierarchical structure with collagen fibers joining more rigid units (scales or osteoderms), thereby increasing flexibility without significantly sacrificing strength, in contrast to rigid monolithic mineral composites. These dermal structures are also multifunctional, with hydrodynamic drag (in fish), coloration for camouflage or intraspecies recognition, temperature and fluid regulation being other important functions. The understanding of such flexible dermal armor is important as it may provide a basis for new synthetic, yet bioinspired, armor materials.

@abstract:
 We present a scheme for exact collision detection between complex models undergoing rigid motion and deformation. The scheme relies on a hierarchical model representation using axis-aligned bounding boxes (AABBs). Recent work has shown that AABB trees are slower than oriented bounding box (OBB) trees for performing overlap tests. In this paper, we describe a way to speed up overlap tests between AABBs, such that for collision detection of rigid models, the difference in performance between the two representations is greatly reduced. Furthermore, we show how to update an AABB tree quickly as a model is deformed. We thus find AABB trees to be the method of choice for collision detection of complex models undergoing deformation. In fact, because they are not much slower to test, are faster to build, and use less storage than OBB trees, AABB trees might be a reasonable choice for rigid models as well.

@abstract:
 An outstanding problem in the field of high-transition-temperature (high-Tc) superconductivity is the identification of the normal state out of which superconductivity emerges in the mysterious underdoped regime. The normal state uncomplicated by thermal fluctuations can be studied using applied magnetic fields that are sufficiently strong to suppress long-range superconductivity at low temperatures. Proposals in which the normal ground state is characterized by small Fermi surface pockets that exist in the absence of symmetry breaking have been superseded by models based on the existence of a superlattice that breaks the translational symmetry of the underlying lattice. Recently, a charge superlattice model that positions a small electron-like Fermi pocket in the vicinity of the nodes (where the superconducting gap is minimum) has been proposed as a replacement for the prevalent superlattice models that position the Fermi pocket in the vicinity of the pseudogap at the antinodes (where the superconducting gap is maximum). Although some ingredients of symmetry breaking have been recently revealed by crystallographic studies, their relevance to the electronic structure remains unresolved. Here we report angle-resolved quantum oscillation measurements in the underdoped copper oxide YBa2Cu3O6 + x. These measurements reveal a normal ground state comprising electron-like Fermi surface pockets located in the vicinity of the nodes, and also point to an underlying superlattice structure of low frequency and long wavelength with features in common with the charge order identified recently by complementary spectroscopic techniques.

For these examples, the technique gives faster convergence to the global minimum than previous approaches.

@abstract:
 We give an algorithm which extracts vortex filaments ("smoke rings") from a given 3D velocity field. Given a filament strength h {\textgreater} 0, an optimal number of vortex filaments, together with their extent and placement, is given by the zero set of a complex valued function over the domain. This function is the global minimizer of a quadratic energy based on a Schrodinger operator. Computationally this amounts to finding the eigenvector belonging to the smallest eigenvalue of a Laplacian type sparse matrix. Turning traditional vector field representations of flows, for example, on a regular grid, into a corresponding set of vortex filaments is useful for visualization, analysis of measured flows, hybrid simulation methods, and sparse representations. To demonstrate our method we give examples from each of these.

 We report on our systematic investigation of Au nanoparticles highly dispersed in the mesopores of (s)-(-)-2-pyrrolidinone-5-carboxylic acid (Py)-modified SBA-15 (Au/SBA-15-Py) by using a series of modern techniques. 13C NMR and IR spectroscopies indicate that Py species are successfully grafted on the surface of mesopores in SBA-15; XRD patterns and N2 adsorption isotherms show that the sample mesostructures are well preserved; TEM images clearly confirm the uniform Au nanoparticles in the mesopores; and XPS suggests an interaction between Au nanoparticles with Py species. Interestingly, Au/SBA-15-Py catalysts always exhibit superior catalytic properties in the oxidation of cyclohexene and styrene by molecular oxygen at atmospheric pressure, compared with the pyrrolidone-free SBA-15 supported Au catalyst (Au/SBA-15-N). This phenomenon is reasonably related to the interaction between Au nanoparticles with Py species, which is consistent with results analyzed from our density-functional theory (DFT) calculations. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.

 We report a real-space visualization of the formation of hydrogen bonding in 8-hydroxyquinoline (8-hq) molecular assemblies on a Cu(111) substrate, using noncontact atomic force microscopy (NC-AFM). The atomically resolved molecular structures enable a precise determination of the characteristics of hydrogen bonding networks, including the bonding sites, orientations, and lengths. The observation of bond contrast was interpreted by ab initio density functional calculations, which indicated the electron density contribution from the hybridized electronic state of the hydrogen bond. Intermolecular coordination between the dehydrogenated 8-hq and Cu adatoms was also revealed by the submolecular resolution AFM characterization. The direct identification of local bonding configurations by NC-AFM would facilitate detailed investigations of intermolecular interactions in complex molecules with multiple active sites.

@abstract:
 We present here an exhaustive ab initio study of the use of carbon-based tips as electrodes in single-molecule junctions. Motivated by recent experiments, we show that carbon tips can be combined with other carbon nanostructures, such as graphene, to form all-carbon molecular junctions with molecules like benzene or C60. Our results show that the use of carbon tips can lead to relatively conductive molecular junctions. However, contrary to junctions formed with standard metals, the conductance traces recorded during the formation of the all-carbon single-molecule junctions do not exhibit clear conductance plateaus, which can be attributed to the inability of the hydrogenated carbon tips to form chemical bonds with the organic molecules. Additionally, we explore here the use of carbon tips for scanning tunneling microscopy and show that they are well suited for obtaining sample images with atomic resolution.

@abstract:
 Macromolecules carrying biological informa- tion often consist of independent modules containing recurring structural motifs. Detection ofa specific structural motif within a protein (or DNA) aids in elucidating the role played by the protein (DNA element) and the mechanism ofits operation. The number of crystallographically known structures at high res- olution is increasing very rapidly. Yet, comparison of three- dimensional structures is a laborious time-consuming proce- dure that typically requires a manual phase. To date, there is no fast automated procedure for structural comparisons. We present an efficient 0(n3) worst case time complexity algorithm for achieving such a goal (where n is the number of atoms in the examined structure). The method is truly three-dimensional, sequence-order-independent, and thus insensitive to gaps, in- sertions, or deletions. This algorithm is based on the geometric hashing paradigm, which was originally developed for object recognition problems in computer vision. It introduces an indexing approach based on transformation invariant repre- sentations and is especially geared toward efficient recognition of partial structures in rigid objects belonging to large data bases. This algorithm is suitable for quick scanning of struc- tural data bases and will detect a recurring structural motif that is a priori unknown. The algorithm uses protein (or DNA) structures, atomic labels, and their three-dimensional coordi- nates. Additional information pertaining to the structure speeds the comparisons. The algorithm is straightforwardly parallelizable, and several versions of it for computer vision applications have been implemented on the massively parallel connection machine. A prototype version of the algorithm has been implemented and applied to the detection ofsubstructures in proteins.

@abstract:
 We introduce a scanning probe technique that enables three-dimensional imaging of local electrostatic potential fields with subnanometer resolution. Registering single electron charging events of a molecular quantum dot attached to the tip of an atomic force microscope operated at 5 K, equipped with a qPlus tuning fork, we image the quadrupole field of a single molecule. To demonstrate quantitative measurements, we investigate the dipole field of a single metal adatom adsorbed on a metal surface. We show that because of its high sensitivity the technique can probe electrostatic potentials at large distances from their sources, which should allow for the imaging of samples with increased surface roughness.

@title:    Matrix capsules with EM routing
@keywords: Folder - Artificial{\_}Inteligence{\_}Robotocs - Capsule
@author:   Work, Revious and Capsules, O N
@abstract:
 A capsule is a group of neurons whose outputs represent different properties of the same entity. We describe a version of capsules in which each capsule has a logis-tic unit to represent the presence of an entity and a 4x4 pose matrix which could learn to represent the relationship between that entity and the viewer. A capsule in one layer votes for the pose matrix of many different capsules in the layer above by multiplying its own pose matrix by viewpoint-invariant transformation matri-ces that could learn to represent part-whole relationships. Each of these votes is weighted by an assignment coefficient. These coefficients are iteratively updated using the EM algorithm such that the output of each capsule is routed to a cap-sule in the layer above that receives a cluster of similar votes. The whole system is trained discriminatively by unrolling 3 iterations of EM between each pair of adjacent layers. On the smallNORB benchmark, capsules reduce the number of test errors by 45{\%} compared to the state-of-the-art. Capsules also show far more resistance to white box adversarial attack than our baseline convolutional neural network.

@abstract:
 The investigation of photochemical processes is a highly active field in computational chemistry. One research direction is the automated exploration and identification of minimum energy conical intersection (MECI) geometries. However, due to the immense technical effort required to calculate nonadiabatic potential energy landscapes, the routine application of such computational protocols is severely limited. In this study, we will discuss the prospect of combining adiabatic potential energy surfaces from semiempirical quantum mechanical calculations with specialized confinement potential and metadynamics simulations to identify S0/T1 minimum energy crossing point (MECP) geometries. It is shown that MECPs calculated at the GFN2-xTB level can provide suitable approximations to high-level S0/S1ab initio conical intersection geometries at a fraction of the computational cost. Reference MECIs of benzene are studied to illustrate the basic concept. An example application of the presented protocol is demonstrated for a set of photoswitch molecules.

 The structure determination of surface species has long been a challenge because of their rich chemical heterogeneities. Modern tip-based microscopic techniques can resolve heterogeneities from their distinct electronic, geometric, and vibrational properties at the single-molecule level but with limited interpretation from each. Here, we combined scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), noncontact atomic force microscopy (AFM), and tip-enhanced Raman scattering (TERS) to characterize an assumed inactive system, pentacene on the Ag(110) surface. This enabled us to unambiguously correlate the structural and chemical heterogeneities of three pentacene-derivative species through specific carbon-hydrogen bond breaking. The joint STM-AFM-TERS strategy provides a comprehensive solution for determining chemical structures that are widely present in surface catalysis, on-surface synthesis, and two-dimensional materials.

@abstract:
 Data sets of benchmark interaction energies in noncovalent complexes are an important tool for quantifying the accuracy of computational methods used in this field, as well as for the development of new computational approaches. This review is intended as a guide to conscious use of these data sets. We discuss their construction and accuracy, list the data sets available in the literature, and demonstrate their application to validation and parametrization of quantum-mechanical computational methods. In practical model systems, the benchmark interaction energies are usually obtained using composite CCSD(T)/CBS schemes. To use these results as a benchmark, their accuracy should be estimated first. We analyze the errors of this methodology with respect to both the approximations involved and the basis set size. We list the most prominent data sets covering various aspects of the field, from general ones to sets focusing on specific types of interactions or systems. The benchmark data are then used to validate more efficient computational approaches, including those based on explicitly correlated methods. Special attention is paid to the transition to large systems, where accurate benchmarking is difficult or impossible, and to the importance of nonequilibrium geometries in parametrization of more approximate methods.

@abstract:
 The computational simulation of photo-induced processes in large molecular systems is a very challenging problem. Firstly, to properly simulate photo-induced reactions the potential energy surfaces corresponding to excited states must be appropriately accessed; secondly, understanding the mechanisms of these processes requires the exploration of complex configurational spaces and the localization of conical intersections; finally, photo-induced reactions are probability events, that require the simulation of hundreds of trajectories to obtain the statistical information for the analysis of the reaction profiles. Here, we present a detailed description of our implementation of a molecular dynamics with electronic transitions algorithm within the local-orbital density functional theory code FIREBALL, suitable for the computational study of these problems. As an example of the application of this approach, we also report results on the [2 + 2] cycloaddition of ethylene with maleic anhydride and on the [2 + 2] photo-induced polymerization reaction of two C60 molecules. We identify different deactivation channels of the initial electron excitation, depending on the time of the electronic transition from LUMO to HOMO, and the character of the HOMO after the transition.

 Induction of homochirality on surfaces via cooperatively amplified interactions in molecular monolayers is a new phenomenon of supramolecular surface chirality. Prochiral molecules will turn into either handedness upon adsorption, but doping with intrinsically chiral molecules breaks further symmetry and induces homochirality. A similar effect is observed at small enantiomeric excess among chiral molecules. The excess molecules provide the chiral bias that becomes amplified into single lattice chirality. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

@abstract:
 First principles electronic structure calculations are typically performed in terms of molecular orbitals (or bands), providing a straightforward theoretical avenue for approximations of increasing sophistication, but do not usually provide any qualitative chemical information about the system. We can derive such information via post-processing using natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis, which produces a chemical picture of bonding in terms of localized Lewis-type bond and lone pair orbitals that we can use to understand molecular structure and interactions. We present NBO analysis of large-scale calculations with the ONETEP linear-scaling density functional theory package, which we have interfaced with the NBO 5 analysis program. In ONETEP calculations involving thousands of atoms, one is typically interested in particular regions of a nanosystem whilst accounting for long-range electronic effects from the entire system. We show that by transforming the Non-orthogonal Generalized Wannier Functions of ONETEP to natural atomic orbitals, NBO analysis can be performed within a localized region in such a way that ensures the results are identical to an analysis on the full system. We demonstrate the capabilities of this approach by performing illustrative studies of large proteins--namely, investigating changes in charge transfer between the heme group of myoglobin and its ligands with increasing system size and between a protein and its explicit solvent, estimating the contribution of electronic delocalization to the stabilization of hydrogen bonds in the binding pocket of a drug-receptor complex, and observing, in situ, the n → $\pi$* hyperconjugative interactions between carbonyl groups that stabilize protein backbones.

@abstract:
 Single functional molecules offer great potential for the development of novel nanoelectronic devices with capabilities beyond today's silicon-based devices. To realise single-molecule electronics, the development of a viable method for connecting functional molecules to each other using single conductive polymer chains is required. The method of initiating chain polymerisation using the tip of a scanning tunnelling microscope (STM) is very useful for fabricating single conductive polymer chains at designated positions and thereby wiring single molecules. In this feature article, developments in the controlled chain polymerisation of diacetylene compounds and the properties of polydiacetylene chains are summarised. Recent studies of "chemical soldering", a technique enabling the covalent connection of single polydiacetylene chains to single functional molecules, are also introduced. This represents a key step in advancing the development of single-molecule electronics.

@abstract:
 Our recently developed method, TranSIESTA, enables modelling of molecular electronic devices under operation conditions. The method is based on density functional theory, and calculates the self-consistent electronic structure of a nanostructure coupled to three-dimensional electrodes with different electrochemical potentials. It uses a full atomistic ab initio description of both the electrodes and the nanoscale device. The calculations reveal information about the scattering states, transmission coefficients, electron current, and non-equilibrium forces in the systems. In this paper we use the method to investigate the electrical properties of three ring phenyl-ethynylene oligomers (OPE). We present results for the electrical effect of side groups and molecular conformations of the molecules. The calculations indicate that molecular switching and negative differential conductance (NDC) are related to rotations of the middle phenyl ring.

@abstract:
 Individual molecules have been demonstrated to exhibit promising applications as functional components in the fabrication of computing nanocircuits. Based on their advantage in chemical tailorability, many molecular devices with advanced electronic functions have been developed, which can be further modulated by the introduction of external stimuli. Here, orthogonally modulated molecular transport junctions are achieved via chemically fabricated nanogaps functionalized with dithienylethene units bearing organometallic ruthenium fragments. The addressable and stepwise control of molecular isomerization can be repeatedly and reversibly completed with a judicious use of the orthogonal optical and electrochemical stimuli to reach the controllable switching of conductivity between two distinct states. These photo-/electro-cooperative nanodevices can be applied as resettable electronic logic gates for Boolean computing, such as a two-input OR and a three-input AND-OR. The proof-of-concept of such logic gates demonstrates the possibility to develop multifunctional molecular devices by rational chemical design.

@abstract:
 We introduce QM7-X, a comprehensive dataset of 42 physicochemical properties for ≈4.2 million equilibrium and non-equilibrium structures of small organic molecules with up to seven non-hydrogen (C, N, O, S, Cl) atoms. To span this fundamentally important region of chemical compound space (CCS), QM7-X includes an exhaustive sampling of (meta-)stable equilibrium structures—comprised of constitutional/structural isomers and stereoisomers, e.g., enantiomers and diastereomers (including cis- / trans - and conformational isomers)—as well as 100 non-equilibrium structural variations thereof to reach a total of ≈4.2 million molecular structures. Computed at the tightly converged quantum-mechanical PBE0+MBD level of theory, QM7-X contains global (molecular) and local (atom-in-a-molecule) properties ranging from ground state quantities (such as atomization energies and dipole moments) to response quantities (such as polarizability tensors and dispersion coefficients). By providing a systematic, extensive, and tightly-converged dataset of quantum-mechanically computed physicochemical properties, we expect that QM7-X will play a critical role in the development of next-generation machine-learning based models for exploring greater swaths of CCS and performing in silico design of molecules with targeted properties.

@abstract:
 This work presents Neural Equivariant Interatomic Potentials (NequIP), an E(3)-equivariant neural network approach for learning interatomic potentials from ab-initio calculations for molecular dynamics simulations. While most contemporary symmetry-aware models use invariant convolutions and only act on scalars, NequIP employs E(3)-equivariant convolutions for interactions of geometric tensors, resulting in a more information-rich and faithful representation of atomic environments. The method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on a challenging and diverse set of molecules and materials while exhibiting remarkable data efficiency. NequIP outperforms existing models with up to three orders of magnitude fewer training data, challenging the widely held belief that deep neural networks require massive training sets. The high data efficiency of the method allows for the construction of accurate potentials using high-order quantum chemical level of theory as reference and enables high-fidelity molecular dynamics simulations over long time scales.

 Herein, we provide new insights into the intermolecular interactions responsible for the intrinsic stability of the duplex structure of a large portion of human B-DNA by using advanced quantum mechanical methods. Our results indicate that (i) the effect of non-neighboring bases on the inter-strand interaction is negligibly small, (ii) London dispersion effects are essential for the stability of the duplex structure, (iii) the largest contribution to the stability of the duplex structure is the Watson-Crick base pairing-consistent with previous computational investigations, (iv) the effect of stacking between adjacent bases is relatively small but still essential for the duplex structure stability and (v) there are no cooperativity effects between intra-strand stacking and inter-strand base pairing interactions. These results are consistent with atomic force microscope measurements and provide the first theoretical validation of nearest neighbor approaches for predicting thermodynamic data of arbitrary DNA sequences.

We provide tomographic maps of force and current as a function of distance that revealed the emergence of strongly directional chemical bonds as tip and sample approach. The force maps show pronounced single, dual, or triple minima depending on the orientation of the tip atom, whereas tunneling current maps showed a single minimum for all three tip conditions. We introduce an angular dependent model for the bonding energy that maps the observed experimental data for all observed orientations and distances.

@abstract:
 “All life is problem solving,” said Popper. To deal with arbitrary problems in arbitrary environments, an ultimate cognitive agent should use its limited hardware in the “best” and “most efficient” possible way. Can we formally nail down this informal statement, and derive a mathematically rigorous blueprint of ultimate cognition? Yes, we can, using Kurt G{\"{o}}del's celebrated self-reference trick of 1931 in a new way. G{\"{o}}del exhibited the limits of mathematics and computation by creating a formula that speaks about itself, claiming to be unprovable by an algorithmic theorem prover: either the formula is true but unprovable, or math itself is flawed in an algorithmic sense. Here we describe an agent-controlling program that speaks about itself, ready to rewrite itself in arbitrary fashion once it has found a proof that the rewrite is useful according to a user-defined utility function. Any such a rewrite is necessarily globally optimal—no local maxima!—since this proof necessarily must have demonstrated the uselessness of continuing the proof search for even better rewrites. Our self-referential program will optimally speed up its proof searcher and other program parts, but only if the speed up's utility is indeed provable—even ultimate cognition has limits of the G{\"{o}}delian kind.

@abstract:
 We introduce a new model of background independent physics in which the degrees of freedom live on a complete graph and the physics is invariant under the permutations of all the points. We argue that the model has a low energy phase in which physics on a low dimensional lattice emerges and the permutation symmetry is broken to the translation group of that lattice. In the high temperature, or disordered, phase the permutation symmetry is respected and the average distance between degrees of freedom is small. This may serve as a tractable model for the emergence of classical geometry in background independent models of spacetime. We use this model to argue for a cosmological scenario in which the universe underwent a transition from the high to the low temperature phase, thus avoiding the horizon problem.

@abstract:
 The combination of computational chemistry and computational materials science with machine learning and artificial intelligence provides a powerful way of relating structural features of nanomaterials with functional properties. However, combining these fundamentally different scientific approaches is not as straightforward as it seems. Machine learning methods were developed for large data sets with small numbers of consistent features. Typically nanomaterials data sets are small, with high dimensionality and high variance in the feature space, and suffer from numerous destructive biases. None of the established data science or machine learning methods in widespread use today were devised with (nano)materials data sets in mind, but there are ways to overcome these challenges and use them reliably. In this review we will discuss domain-specific constraints on data-driven nanomaterials design, and explore the differences between nanomaterials simulation and nanoinformatics that can be leveraged for greater impact.

@abstract:
 Resolving individual atoms has always been the ultimate goal of surface microscopy. The scanning tunneling microscope images atomic-scale features on surfaces, but resolving single atoms within an adsorbed molecule remains a great challenge because the tunneling current is primarily sensitive to the local electron density of states close to the Fermi level. We demonstrate imaging of molecules with unprecedented atomic resolution by probing the short-range chemical forces with use of noncontact atomic force microscopy. The key step is functionalizing the microscope's tip apex with suitable, atomically well-defined terminations, such as CO molecules. Our experimental findings are corroborated by ab initio density functional theory calculations. Comparison with theory shows that Pauli repulsion is the source of the atomic resolution, whereas van der Waals and electrostatic forces only add a diffuse attractive background.

@abstract:
 We compare evolutionary algorithms with minima hopping for global optimization in the field of cluster structure prediction. We introduce a new average offspring recombination operator and compare it with previously used operators. Minima hopping is improved with a softening method and a stronger feedback mechanism. Test systems are atomic clusters with Lennard-Jones interaction as well as silicon and gold clusters described by force fields. The improved minima hopping is found to be well-suited to all these homoatomic problems. The evolutionary algorithm is more efficient for systems with compact and symmetric ground states, including LJ(150), but it fails for systems with very complex energy landscapes and asymmetric ground states, such as LJ(75) and silicon clusters with more than 30 atoms. Both successes and failures of the evolutionary algorithm suggest ways for its improvement.

 Prebiotic possibilities for the synthesis of interstellar ribose through a protic variant of the formose reaction under gas-phase conditions were studied in the absence of any known catalyst. The ion-molecule reaction products, diose and triose, were sought by mass spectrometry, and relevant masses were observed. Ab initio calculations were used to evaluate protic formose mechanism possibilities. A bilateral theoretical and experimental effort yielded a physical model for glycoaldehyde generation whereby a hydronium cation can mediate formaldehyde dimerization followed by covalent bond formation leading to diose and water. These results advance the possibility that ion-molecule reactions between formaldehyde (CH(2)O) and H(3)O(+) lead to formose reaction products and inform us about potential sugar formation processes in interstellar space.

 We introduce a quantum optimal control algorithm for energy minimization that combines the diffeomorphic modulation under observable response preserving homotopy (D-MORPH) gradient and the Broyden Fletcher Goldfarb Shanno (BFGS) iterative scheme for nonlinear optimization. An extended set of controls defining the time-dependent mass, dipole moment, and external perturbational field are optimized to find an effective Hamiltonian that steers the dynamics of the system into the global minimum without getting trapped into local minima. The algorithm is illustrated as applied to energy minimization on rugged surfaces and golf potentials comparable to those previously explored for testing quantum annealing methodologies.

The perspectives for chemical sensitivity in QPCM images are demonstrated for an iron-platinum surface alloy where we observe local variations of the transport current due to changes in the chemical environment of the point contact.

@abstract:
 Measuring similarities/dissimilarities between atomic structures is important for the exploration of potential energy landscapes. However, the cell vectors together with the coordinates of the atoms, which are generally used to describe periodic systems, are quantities not suitable as fingerprints to distinguish structures. Based on a characterization of the local environment of all atoms in a cell we introduce crystal fingerprints that can be calculated easily and allow to define configurational distances between crystalline structures that satisfy the mathematical properties of a metric. This distance between two configurations is a measure of their similarity/dissimilarity and it allows in particular to distinguish structures. The new method is an useful tool within various energy landscape exploration schemes, such as minima hopping, random search, swarm intelligence algorithms and high-throughput screenings.

@abstract:
 First-principles-based force fields prepared from large quantum mechanical data sets are now the norm in predictive molecular dynamics simulations for complex chemical processes, as opposed to force fields fitted solely from phenomenological data. In principle, the former allow improved accuracy and transferability over a wider range of molecular compositions, interactions, and environmental conditions unexplored by experiments. That is, assuming they have been optimally prepared from a diverse training set. The trade-off has been force field engines that are functionally complex, with a large number of nonbonded and bonded analytical forms that give rise to rather large parameter search spaces. To address this problem, we have developed GARFfield (genetic algorithm-based reactive force field optimizer method), a hybrid multiobjective Pareto-optimal parameter development scheme based on genetic algorithms, hill-climbing routines and conjugate-gradient minimization. To demonstrate the capabilities of GARFfield we use it to develop two very different force fields: (1) the ReaxFF reactive force field for modeling the adiabatic reactive dynamics of silicon carbide growth from an methyltrichlorosilane precursor and (2) the SiC electron force field with effective core pseudopotentials for modeling nonadiabatic dynamic phenomena with highly excited electronic states. The flexible and open architecture of GARFfield enables efficient and fast parallel optimization of parameters from quantum mechanical data sets for demanding applications like ReaxFF, electronic fast forward (or electron force field), and others including atomistic reactive charge-optimized many-body interatomic potentials, Morse, and coarse-grain force fields. {\textcopyright} 2014 American Chemical Society.

@abstract:
 We examine power dissipation in different clocking schemes for molecular quantum-dot cellular automata (QCA) circuits. 'Landauer clocking' involves the adiabatic transition of a molecular cell from the null state to an active state carrying data. Cell layout creates devices which allow data in cells to interact and thereby perform useful computation. We perform direct solutions of the equation of motion for the system in contact with the thermal environment and see that Landauer's Principle applies: one must dissipate an energy of at least k(B)T per bit only when the information is erased. The ideas of Bennett can be applied to keep copies of the bit information by echoing inputs to outputs, thus embedding any logically irreversible circuit in a logically reversible circuit, at the cost of added circuit complexity. A promising alternative which we term 'Bennett clocking' requires only altering the timing of the clocking signals so that bit information is simply held in place by the clock until a computational block is complete, then erased in the reverse order of computation. This approach results in ultralow power dissipation without additional circuit complexity. These results offer a concrete example in which to consider recent claims regarding the fundamental limits of binary logic scaling.

@abstract:
 Diatoms are the major contributors to phytoplankton blooms in lakes and in the sea and hence are central in aquatic ecosystems and the global carbon cycle. All free-living diatoms differ from other phytoplankton groups in having silicified cell walls in the form of two 'shells' (the frustule) of manifold shape and intricate architecture whose function and role, if any, in contributing to the evolutionary success of diatoms is under debate. We explored the defence potential of the frustules as armour against predators by measuring their strength. Real and virtual loading tests (using calibrated glass microneedles and finite element analysis) were performed on centric and pennate diatom cells. Here we show that the frustules are remarkably strong by virtue of their architecture and the material properties of the diatom silica. We conclude that diatom frustules have evolved as mechanical protection for the cells because exceptional force is required to break them. The evolutionary arms race between diatoms and their specialized predators will have had considerable influence in structuring pelagic food webs and biogeochemical cycles.

@abstract:
 A combination of interpolation methods and local saddle-point search algorithms is probably the most efficient way of finding transition states in chemical reactions. Interpolation methods such as the growing-string method and the nudged-elastic band are able to find an approximation to the minimum-energy pathway and thereby provide a good initial guess for a transition state and imaginary mode connecting both reactant and product states. Since interpolation methods employ usually just a small number of configurations and converge slowly close to the minimum-energy pathway, local methods such as partitioned rational function optimization methods using either exact or approximate Hessians or minimum-mode-following methods such as the dimer or the Lanczos method have to be used to converge to the transition state. A modification to the original dimer method proposed by [Henkelman and Jonnson J. Chem. Phys. 111, 7010 (1999)] is presented, reducing the number of gradient calculations per cycle from six to four gradients or three gradients and one energy, and significantly improves the overall performance of the algorithm on quantum-chemical potential-energy surfaces, where forces are subject to numerical noise. A comparison is made between the dimer methods and the well-established partitioned rational function optimization methods for finding transition states after the use of interpolation methods. Results for 24 different small- to medium-sized chemical reactions covering a wide range of structural types demonstrate that the improved dimer method is an efficient alternative saddle-point search algorithm on medium-sized to large systems and is often even able to find transition states when partitioned rational function optimization methods fail to converge.

 We present a theoretical study of the elongation process of molecular junctions formed by octanedithiol molecule and Au electrodes. Five types of junctions that have different molecule-electrode coupling geometries are considered. It is found that the behavior of the H atom in the -SH group plays a crucial role in the system structure variation. The variation of the total energy and the average force needed to break the molecular junction are calculated, and each type of molecular junctions is found to have a characteristic breaking force. Comparing our theoretical results with those from experiment shows that the most probable coupling geometry was neglected in almost all the previous work. A dynamic analysis of the electronic structure of the molecular junctions is used to understand the variation of the system configuration.

 Metallocene (MCp2) wires have recently attracted considerable interest in relation to molecular spintronics due to predictions concerning their half-metallic nature. This exciting prospect is however hampered by the little and often-contradictory knowledge we have concerning the metallocene self-assembly and interaction with a metal. Here, we elucidate these aspects by focusing on the adsorption of ferrocene on Cu(111) and Cu(100). Combining low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and density functional theory calculations, we demonstrate that the two-dimensional molecular arrangement consists of vertical- and horizontal-lying molecules. The noncovalent T-shaped interactions between Cp rings of vertical and horizontal molecules are essential for the stability of the physisorbed molecular layer. These results provide a fresh insight into ferrocene adsorption on surfaces and may serve as an archetypal reference for future work with this important variety of organometallic molecules.

@abstract:
 The ability to handle single molecules as effectively as macroscopic building blocks would enable the construction of complex supramolecular structures inaccessible to self-assembly. The fundamental challenges obstructing this goal are the uncontrolled variability and poor observability of atomic-scale conformations. Here, we present a strategy to work around both obstacles and demonstrate autonomous robotic nanofabrication by manipulating single molecules. Our approach uses reinforcement learning (RL), which finds solution strategies even in the face of large uncertainty and sparse feedback. We demonstrate the potential of our RL approach by removing molecules autonomously with a scanning probe microscope from a supramolecular structure. Our RL agent reaches an excellent performance, enabling us to automate a task that previously had to be performed by a human. We anticipate that our work opens the way toward autonomous agents for the robotic construction of functional supramolecular structures with speed, precision, and perseverance beyond our current capabilities.

Manipulation of individual atoms by means of low-temperature scanning tunnelling microscopy provides ways to store data in atoms, encoded either into their charge state, magnetization state or lattice position. A defining challenge at this stage is the controlled integration of these individual functional atoms into extended, scalable atomic circuits. Here we present a robust digital atomic scale memory of up to 1 kilobyte (8,000 bits) using an array of individual surface vacancies in a chlorine terminated Cu(100) surface. The memory can be read and rewritten automatically by means of atomic scale markers, and offers an areal density of 502 Terabits per square inch, outperforming state-of-the-art hard disk drives by three orders of magnitude. Furthermore, the chlorine vacancies are found to be stable at temperatures up to 77 K, offering prospects for expanding large-scale atomic assembly towards ambient conditions.

@abstract:
 We describe a new approach for the purely Eulerian simulation of incompressible fluids. In it, the fluid state is represented by a 2 -valued wave function evolving under the Schr{\"{o}}dinger equation subject to incompressibility constraints. The underlying dynami-cal system is Hamiltonian and governed by the kinetic energy of the fluid together with an energy of Landau-Lifshitz type. The latter ensures that dynamics due to thin vortical structures, all important for visual simulation, are faithfully reproduced. This enables robust simulation of intricate phenomena such as vor-tical wakes and interacting vortex filaments, even on modestly sized grids. Our implementation uses a simple splitting method for time integration, employing the FFT for Schr{\"{o}}dinger evolu-tion as well as constraint projection. Using a standard penalty method we also allow arbitrary obstacles. The resulting algorithm is simple, unconditionally stable, and efficient. In particular it does not require any Lagrangian techniques for advection or to counteract the loss of vorticity. We demonstrate its use in a va-riety of scenarios, compare it with experiments, and evaluate it against benchmark tests. A full implementation is included in the ancillary materials.

@abstract:
 The Darwinian nature of Wojciech Zurek's theory of Quantum Darwinism is evaluated against the criteria of a Darwinian process as understood within Universal Darwinism. The characteristics of a Darwinian process are developed including the consequences of accumulated adaptations resulting in adaptive systems operating in accordance with Friston's free energy principle and employing environmental simulations. Quantum theory, as developed in Zurek's research program and encapsulated by his theory of Quantum Darwinism is discussed from the view that Zurek's derivation of the measurement axioms implies that the evolution of a quantum system entangled with environmental entities is determined solely by the nature of the entangled system. There need be no further logical foundation. Quantum Darwinism is found to conform to the Darwinian paradigm in unexpected detail and is thus may be considered a theory within the framework of Universal Darwinism. With the inclusion of Quantum Darwinism within Universal Darwinism and the explanatory power of Darwinian processes extended beyond biology and the social sciences to include the creation and evolution of scientific subject matter within particle physics, atomic physics and chemistry, it is suggested that Universal Darwinism may be considered a candidate 'Theory of Everything' as anticipated by David Deutsch.

 Molecular docking has become an increasingly important tool for drug discovery. In this review, we present a brief introduction of the available molecular docking methods, and their development and applications in drug discovery. The relevant basic theories, including sampling algorithms and scoring functions, are summarized. The differences in and performance of available docking software are also discussed. Flexible receptor molecular docking approaches, especially those including backbone flexibility in receptors, are a challenge for available docking methods. A recently developed Local Move Monte Carlo (LMMC) based approach is introduced as a potential solution to flexible receptor docking problems.

@abstract:
 The underlying mechanisms of image distortions in atomic force microscopy (AFM) with CO-terminated tips are identified and studied in detail. AFM measurements of a partially fluorinated hydrocarbon molecule recorded with a CO-terminated tip are compared with state-of-the-art ab initio calculations. The hydrogenated and fluorinated carbon rings in the molecule appear different in size, which primarily originates from the different extents of their $\pi$-electrons. Further, tilting of the CO at the tip, induced by van der Waals forces, enlarges the apparent size of parts of the molecule by up to 50{\%}. Moreover, the CO tilting in response to local Pauli repulsion causes a significant sharpening of the molecule bonds in AFM imaging.

@abstract:
 High-resolution atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) imaging with functionalized tips is well established, but a detailed understanding of the imaging mechanism is still missing. We present a numerical STM/AFM model, which takes into account the relaxation of the probe due to the tip-sample interaction. We demonstrate that the model is able to reproduce very well not only the experimental intra- and intermolecular contrasts, but also their evolution upon tip approach. At close distances, the simulations unveil a significant probe particle relaxation towards local minima of the interaction potential. This effect is responsible for the sharp submolecular resolution observed in AFM/STM experiments. In addition, we demonstrate that sharp apparent intermolecular bonds should not be interpreted as true hydrogen bonds, in the sense of representing areas of increased electron density. Instead, they represent the ridge between two minima of the potential energy landscape due to neighboring atoms. {\textcopyright} 2014 American Physical Society.

 The aim of docking is to accurately predict the structure of a ligand within the constraints of a receptor binding site and to correctly estimate the strength of binding. We discuss, in detail, methodological developments that occurred in the docking field in 2010 and 2011, with a particular focus on the more difficult, and sometimes controversial, aspects of this promising computational discipline. The main developments in docking in this period, covered in this review, are receptor flexibility, solvation, fragment docking, postprocessing, docking into homology models, and docking comparisons. Several new, or at least newly invigorated, advances occurred in areas such as nonlinear scoring functions, using machine-learning approaches. This review is strongly focused on docking advances in the context of drug design, specifically in virtual screening and fragment-based drug design. Where appropriate, we refer readers to exemplar case studies.

 Molecular nanostructures may constitute the fabric of future quantum technologies, if their degrees of freedom can be fully harnessed. Ideally one might use nuclear spins as low-decoherence qubits and optical excitations for fast controllable interactions. Here, we present a method for entangling two nuclear spins through their mutual coupling to a transient optically excited electron spin, and investigate its feasibility through density-functional theory and experiments on a test molecule. From our calculations we identify the specific molecular properties that permit high entangling power gates under simple optical and microwave pulses; synthesis of such molecules is possible with established techniques.

@abstract:
 We use rotational excitation spectroscopy with a scanning tunneling microscope to investigate the rotational properties of molecular hydrogen and its isotopes physisorbed on the surfaces of graphene and hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), grown on Ni(111), Ru(0001), and Rh(111). The rotational excitation energies are in good agreement with $\Delta$J = 2 transitions of freely spinning p-H2 and o-D2 molecules. The variations of the spectral line shapes for H2 among the different surfaces can be traced back to a molecular resonance-mediated tunneling mechanism. Our data for H2/h-BN/Rh(111) suggest a local intrinsic gating on this surface due to lateral static dipoles. Spectra on a mixed monolayer of H2, HD, and D2 display all three J = 0 → 2 rotational transitions, irrespective of tip position, thus pointing to a multimolecule excitation, or molecular mobility in the physisorbed close-packed layer.

@abstract:
 The unwinding free energy of 128 DNA octamers was correlated with the sum of interaction energies among DNA bases and their solvation energies. The former energies were determined by using the recently developed density functional theory procedure augmented by London dispersion energy (RI-DFT-D) that provides accurate hydrogen-bonding and stacking energies highly comparable with CCSD(T)/complete basis set limit benchmark data. Efficient tight-binding DFT covering dispersion energy was also used and yielded satisfactory resuits. The latter method can be used for extended systems. The solvation energy was determined by using a C-PCM continuum solvent at HF level calculations. Various models were adopted to correlate theoretical energies with experimental unwinding free energies. Unless all energy components (hydrogen-bonding, intra- and interstrand-stacking, and solvation energies) were included and weighted individually, no satisfactory correlation resulted. The most advanced model yielded very close correlation (RMSE = 0.32 kcal mol-1) fully comparable with the entirely empirical correlation introduced in the original paper.[3] Analysis of the theoretical results shows the importance of inter- and intramolecular stacking energies, and especially the latter term plays a key role in determining DNA-duplex stabilization. {\textcopyright} 2007 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH {\&} Co.

@author:   Sun, Qiming
@doi:      10.1002/jcc.23981
@abstract:
 An efficient integral library Libcint was designed to automatically implement general integrals for Gaussian-type scalar and spinor basis functions. The library can handle arbitrary integral expressions on top of {\$}\backslashmathbf{\{}p{\}}{\$}, {\$}\backslashmathbf{\{}r{\}}{\$} and {\$}\backslashsigma{\$} operators with one-electron overlap and nuclear attraction, two-electron Coulomb and Gaunt operators. Using a symbolic algebra tool, new integrals are derived and translated to C code programmatically. The generated integrals can be used in various types of molecular properties. In the present work, we computed the analytical gradients and NMR shielding constants at both non-relativistic and four-component relativistic Hartree-Fock level to demonstrate the capability of the integral library. Due to the use of kinetically balanced basis and gauge including atomic orbitals, the relativistic analytical gradients and shielding constants requires the integral library to handle the fifth-order electron repulsion integral derivatives. The generality of the integral library is achieved without losing efficiency. On the modern multi-CPU platform, Libcint can easily reach the overall throughput being many times of the I/O bandwidth. On a 20-core node, we are able to achieve an average output 7.9 GB/s for C{\$}{\_}{\{}60{\}}{\$} molecule with cc-pVTZ basis.

@abstract:
 The design and synthesis of protein-like polymers is a fundamental challenge in materials science. A biomimetic approach is to explore the impact of monomer sequence on non-natural polymer structure and function. We present the aqueous self-assembly of two peptoid polymers into extremely thin two-dimensional (2D) crystalline sheets directed by periodic amphiphilicity, electrostatic recognition and aromatic interactions. Peptoids are sequence-specific, oligo-N-substituted glycine polymers designed to mimic the structure and functionality of proteins. Mixing a 1:1 ratio of two oppositely charged peptoid 36mers of a specific sequence in aqueous solution results in the formation of giant, free-floating sheets with only 2.7 nm thickness. Direct visualization of aligned individual peptoid chains in the sheet structure was achieved using aberration-corrected transmission electron microscopy. Specific binding of a protein to ligand-functionalized sheets was also demonstrated. The synthetic flexibility and biocompatibility of peptoids provide a flexible and robust platform for integrating functionality into defined 2D nanostructures.

@abstract:
 The ability to manipulate electron spin in organic molecular materials offers a new and extremely tantalizing route towards spin electronics, both from fundamental and technological points of view. This is mainly due to the unquestionable advantage of weak spin-orbit and hyperfine interactions in organic molecules, which leads to the possibility of preserving spin-coherence over times and distances much longer than in conventional metals or semiconductors. Here we demonstrate theoretically that organic spin valves, obtained by sandwiching an organic molecule between magnetic contacts, can show a large bias-dependent magnetoresistance and that this can be engineered by an appropriate choice of molecules and anchoring groups. Our results, obtained through a combination of state-of-the-art non-equilibrium transport methods and density functional theory, show that although the magnitude of the effect varies with the details of the molecule, large magnetoresistance can be found both in the tunnelling and the metallic limit.

 The importance and mechanisms of transient mobility of atoms and$\backslash$nmolecules adsorbing at surfaces have been a subject of controversy for$\backslash$nmany years. We used classical molecular dynamics simulations to examine$\backslash$ntransient mobility of Pd atoms adsorbing on the MgO (100) surface with$\backslash$nincident kinetic energies not exceeding 0.4 eV.

For our selected deposition conditions, aimed at simulation$\backslash$nof Pd cluster growth experiments, an estimated 76{\%} of the impinging Pd$\backslash$natoms are expected to travel up to 20 angstrom away from the collision$\backslash$nsite before capture on a 5 K surface. We find that mobility of metal$\backslash$natoms on oxide surfaces is expected to decrease with decreasing incident$\backslash$nenergy and increase with decreasing incident angle. Comparison with$\backslash$nprior studies highlights similarities and differences With other surface$\backslash$ndiffusion processes, such as long jumps. At higher surface temperatures,$\backslash$nthe observed mobility will mainly be due to thermally activated$\backslash$nprocesses rather than transient mobility mechanisms. Atoms that exhibit$\backslash$ntransient mobility upon deposition may quickly migrate to surface$\backslash$nfeatures and defects affecting kinetics of growth and structures of$\backslash$nnanoclusters and surface layers.

@doi:      10.1103/PhysRevB.81.245307
@abstract:
 In recent years many experiments have demonstrated the possibility to achieve efficient photoluminescence from Si/SiO2 nanocrystals. While it is widely known that only a minor portions of the nanocrystals in the samples contribute to the observed photoluminescence, the high complexity of the Si/SiO2 interface and the dramatic sensitivity to the fabrication conditions make the identification of the most active structures at the experimental level not a trivial task. Focusing on this aspect we have addressed the problem theoretically, by calculating the radiative recombination rates for different classes of Si-nanocrystals in the diameter range of 0.2-1.5 nm, in order to identify the best conditions for optical emission. We show that the recombination rates of hydrogenated nanocrystals follow the quantum confinement feature in which the nanocrystal diameter is the principal quantity in determining the system response. Interestingly, a completely different behavior emerges from the OH-terminated or SiO2-embedded nanocrystals, where the number of oxygens at the interface seems intimately connected to the recombination rates, resulting the most important quantity for the characterization of the optical yield in such systems. Besides, additional conditions for the achievement of high rates are constituted by a high crystallinity of the nanocrystals and by high confinement energies (small diameters).

 Adaptive laser pulse shaping has enabled impressive control over photophysical processes in complex molecules. However, the optimal pulse shape that emerges rarely offers straightforward insight into the excited-state properties being manipulated. We have shown that the emission quantum yield of a donor-acceptor macromolecule (a phenylene ethynylene dendrimer tethered to perylene) can be enhanced by 15{\%} through iterative phase modulation of the excitation pulse. Furthermore, by analyzing the pulse optimization process and optimal pulse features, we successfully isolated the dominant elements underlying the control mechanism. We demonstrated that a step function in the spectral phase directs the postexcitation dynamics of the donor moiety, thus characterizing the coherent nature of the donor excited state. An accompanying pump-probe experiment implicates a 2+1 photon control pathway, in which the optimal pulse promotes a delayed excitation to a second excited state through favorable quantum interference.

@abstract:
 Spider dragline silk has enormous potential for the development of biomimetic fibers that combine strength and elasticity in low density polymers. These applications necessitate understanding how silk reacts to different environmental conditions. For instance, spider dragline silk ;supercontracts' in high humidity. During supercontraction, unrestrained dragline silk contracts up to 50{\%} of its original length and restrained fibers generate substantial stress. Here we characterize the response of dragline silk to changes in humidity before, during and after supercontraction. Our findings demonstrate that dragline silk exhibits two qualitatively different responses to humidity. First, silk undergoes a previously unknown cyclic relaxation-contraction response to wetting and drying. The direction and magnitude of this cyclic response is identical both before and after supercontraction. By contrast, supercontraction is a ;permanent' tensioning of restrained silk in response to high humidity. Here, water induces stress, rather than relaxation and the uptake of water molecules results in a permanent change in molecular composition of the silk, as demonstrated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Even after drying, silk mass increased by approximately 1{\%} after supercontraction. By contrast, the cyclic response to humidity involves a reversible uptake of water. Dried, post-supercontraction silk also differs mechanically from virgin silk. Post-supercontraction silk exhibits reduced stiffness and stress at yield, as well as changes in dynamic energy storage and dissipation. In addition to advancing understanding supercontraction, our findings open up new applications for synthetic silk analogs. For example, dragline silk emerges as a model for a biomimetic muscle, the contraction of which is precisely controlled by humidity alone.

@abstract:
 Two-dimensional (2D) materials are a new class of materials with interesting physical properties and applications ranging from nanoelectronics to sensing and photonics. In addition to graphene, the most studied 2D material, monolayers of other layered materials such as semiconducting dichalcogenides MoS2 or WSe2 are gaining in importance as promising channel materials for field-effect transistors (FETs). The presence of a direct bandgap in monolayer MoS2 due to quantum-mechanical confinement allows room-temperature FETs with an on/off ratio exceeding 10(8). The presence of high- $\kappa$ dielectrics in these devices enhanced their mobility, but the mechanisms are not well understood. Here, we report on electrical transport measurements on MoS2 FETs in different dielectric configurations. The dependence of mobility on temperature shows clear evidence of the strong suppression of charged-impurity scattering in dual-gate devices with a top-gate dielectric. At the same time, phonon scattering shows a weaker than expected temperature dependence. High levels of doping achieved in dual-gate devices also allow the observation of a metal-insulator transition in monolayer MoS2 due to strong electron-electron interactions. Our work opens up the way to further improvements in 2D semiconductor performance and introduces MoS2 as an interesting system for studying correlation effects in mesoscopic systems.

 Femtosecond high-resolution pump-probe experiments have been used together with theoretical ab initio quantum calculations and wave packet dynamics simulations to decode an optimal femtosecond pulse that is generated from adaptive learning algorithms. This pulse is designed to maximize the yield of the organometallic ion CpMn(CO)3 while hindering the competing fragmentation.

@abstract:
 We examine the effectiveness of a simple method for surmounting energy barriers and enhancing the exploration of configuration space in Monte Carlo (MC) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Proposed previously for treating surface diffusion [M. M. Steiner, P.-A. Genilloud, and J. W. Wilkins, Phys. Rev. B 57, 10236 (1998)], the method has widespread applicability and is particularly advantageous for systems with potential energy landscapes whose features are not known a priori. The algorithm requires selection of a single parameter, a "boost energy" E-B. The MC or MD simulation is carried out on an effective potential energy function that is equal to the true potential energy when it is greater than E-B, but is equal to E-B otherwise. Since the effective potential energy is, therefore, never less than E-B, deep energy minima are removed analogous to a rough landscape that has been flooded with water. The bias introduced by altering the potential energy function in this way is easily and rigorously removed "on-the- fly." We test the method with a MD simulation of the equilibrium populations of conformations of n-pentane. The method recovers the canonical equilibrium distribution with dramatically increased sampling efficiency and modest additional computational overhead, over a range of temperatures. In cases for which the potential energy function can be written as a sum of terms, the energy boost can be applied to the selected terms rather than to the entire potential energy function. We illustrate this by application to the dihedral angle term only of the empirical n-pentane potential energy function and show that this further enhances sampling efficiency. The simple nature of this algorithm allows it to be readily scaled to high-dimensional systems. We discuss the prognosis for applying this method to more complex systems such as liquids and macromolecules. (C) 2002 American Institute of Physics

@abstract:
 Molecular mechanics is the tool of choice for the modeling of systems that are so large or complex that it is impractical or impossible to model them by ab initio methods. For this reason there is a need for accurate potentials that are able to quickly reproduce ab initio quality results at the fraction of the cost. The interactions within force fields are represented by a number of functions. Some interactions are well understood and can be represented by simple mathematical functions while others are not so well understood and their functional form is represented in a simplistic manner or not even known. In the last 20 years there have been the first examples of a new design ethic, where novel and contemporary methods using machine learning, in particular, artificial neural networks, have been used to find the nature of the underlying functions of a force field. Here we appraise what has been achieved over this time and what requires further improvements, while offering some insight and guidance for the development of future force fields.

 The critical quantity in understanding imaging using an atomic force microscope is the force the sample exerts on the tip. We put forward a simple one-to-one force to water density relationship, explain exactly how it occurs, and in which circumstances it holds. We argue that two wide classes of atomic force microscope (AFM) tip should lead to at least qualitative agreement with our model and represent a significant fraction of AFM tips as currently prepared. This connection between the short-range force and the unperturbed equilibrium water density removes the need to perform simulations for each tip location, conservatively speeding up simulations by around three orders of magnitude compared to current methods that explicitly calculate the force on a tip model at each point in space.

@url:      http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00214-012-1298-4
@abstract:
 The natural orbital functional theory provides two complementary representations of the one-electron picture in molecules, namely, the natural orbital (NO) representation and the canonical orbital (CO) representation. The former arises directly from the optimization process solving the corresponding Euler equations, whereas the latter is attained from the diagonalization of the matrix of Lagrange multipliers obtained in the NO representation. In general, the one-particle reduced-density matrix (1-RDM) and the Lagrangian cannot be simultaneously brought to the diagonal form, except for the special Hartree-Fock case. The 1-RDM is diagonal in the NO representation, but not the Lagrangian, which is only a Hermitian matrix. Conversely, in the CO representation, the Lagrangian is diagonal, but not the 1-RDM. Combining both representations we have the whole picture concerning the occupation numbers and the orbital energies. The Piris natural orbital functional 5 leads generally to the localization of the molecular orbitals in the NO representation. Accordingly, it provides an orbital picture that agrees closely with the empirical valence shell electron pair repulsion theory and the Bent's rule, along with the theoretical valence bond method. On the other hand, the equivalent CO representation can afford delocalized molecular orbitals adapted to the symmetry of the molecule. We show by means of the extended Koopmans' theorem that the one-particle energies associated with the COs can yield reasonable principal ionization potentials when the 1-RDM remains close to the diagonal form. The relationship between NOs and COs is illustrated by several examples, showing that both orbital representations complement each other. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.

 A lack of consensus persists regarding the origin of photoluminescence in silicon nanocrystals. Here we report pressure-dependences of X-ray diffraction and photoluminescence from alkane-terminated colloidal particles. We determine the diamond-phase bulk modulus, observe multiple phase transitions, and importantly find a systematic photoluminescence red shift that matches the X(conduction)-to-$\Gamma$(valence) transition of bulk crystalline silicon. These results, reinforced by calculations, suggest that the efficient photoluminescence, frequently attributed to defects, arises instead from core-states that remain highly indirect despite quantum confinement.

@abstract:
 Atomically thin sheets of sp(2)-hybridized carbon--graphene--have enormous potential for applications in future electronic devices. Particularly promising are nanostructured (sub)units of graphene, the electronic properties of which can be tuned by changing the spatial extent or the specific edge termination of the carbon network. Processability and precise tailoring of graphene-derived structures are, however, still major obstacles in developing applications; both bottom-up and top-down routes are presently under investigation in attempts to overcome this limitation. Here, we propose a surface chemical route that allows for the atomically precise fabrication of tailored nanographenes from polyphenylene precursors. The cyclodehydrogenation of a prototypical polyphenylene on Cu(111) is studied using scanning tunnelling microscopy and density functional theory. We find that the thermally induced cyclodehydrogenation proceeds via several intermediate steps, two of which can be stabilized on the surface, yielding unprecedented insight into a dehydrogenative intramolecular aryl-aryl coupling reaction.

@abstract:
 Highly excited heterogeneous complex materials are essential elements of important processes, ranging from inertial confinement fusion to semiconductor device fabrication. Understanding the dynamics of these systems has been challenging because of the difficulty in extracting mechanistic information from either experiment or theory. We describe here the electron force field (eFF) approximation to quantum mechanics which provides a practical approach to simulating the dynamics of such systems. eFF includes all the normal electrostatic interactions between electrons and nuclei and the normal quantum mechanical description of kinetic energy for the electrons, but contains two severe approximations: first, the individual electrons are represented as floating Gaussian wave packets whose position and size respond instantaneously to various forces during the dynamics; and second, these wave packets are combined into a many-body wave function as a Hartree product without explicit antisymmetrization. The Pauli principle is accounted for by adding an extra spin-dependent term to the Hamiltonian. These approximations are a logical extension of existing approaches to simulate the dynamics of fermions, which we review. In this paper, we discuss the details of the equations of motion and potentials that form eFF, and evaluate the ability of eFF to describe ground-state systems containing covalent, ionic, multicenter, and/or metallic bonds. We also summarize two eFF calculations previously reported on electronically excited systems: (1) the thermodynamics of hydrogen compressed up to ten times liquid density and heated up to 200 000 K; and (2) the dynamics of Auger fragmentation in a diamond nanoparticle, where hundreds of electron volts of excitation energy are dissipated over tens of femtoseconds. These cases represent the first steps toward using eFF to model highly excited electronic processes in complex materials.

@abstract:
 Recent advances in scanning transmission electron and scanning probe microscopies have opened exciting opportunities in probing the materials structural parameters and various functional properties in real space with angstrom-level precision. This progress has been accompanied by an exponential increase in the size and quality of data sets produced by microscopic and spectroscopic experimental techniques. These developments necessitate adequate methods for extracting relevant physical and chemical information from the large data sets, for which a priori information on the structures of various atomic configurations and lattice defects is limited or absent. Here we demonstrate an application of deep neural networks to extract information from atomically resolved images including location of the atomic species and type of defects. We develop a "weakly supervised" approach that uses information on the coordinates of all atomic species in the image, extracted via a deep neural network, to identify a rich variety of defects that are not part of an initial training set. We further apply our approach to interpret complex atomic and defect transformation, including switching between different coordination of silicon dopants in graphene as a function of time, formation of peculiar silicon dimer with mixed 3-fold and 4-fold coordination, and the motion of molecular "rotor". This deep learning-based approach resembles logic of a human operator, but can be scaled leading to significant shift in the way of extracting and analyzing information from raw experimental data.

@abstract:
 The development of chemical systems with switchable molecular spins could lead to the architecture of materials with controllable magnetic or spintronic properties. Here, we present conclusive evidence that the spin of an organometallic molecule coupled to a ferromagnetic substrate can be switched between magnetic off and on states by a chemical stimulus. This is achieved by nitric oxide (NO) functioning as an axial ligand of cobalt(II)tetraphenylporphyrin (CoTPP) ferromagnetically coupled to nickel thin-film (Ni(001)). On NO addition, the coordination sphere of Co(2+) is modified and a NO-CoTPP nitrosyl complex is formed, which corresponds to an off state of the Co spin. Thermal dissociation of NO from the nitrosyl complex restores the on state of the Co spin. The NO-induced reversible off-on switching of surface-adsorbed molecular spins observed here is attributed to a spin trans effect.

@abstract:
 Silica is the main component of the Earth's crust and is also of great relevance in many branches of materials science and technology. Its phase diagram is rather intricate and exhibits many different crystalline phases. The reported propensity to amorphization and the strong influence on the outcome of the initial structure and of the pressurization protocol indicate the presence of metastability and large kinetic barriers. As a consequence, theory is also faced with great difficulties and our understanding of the complex transformation mechanisms is still very sketchy despite a large number of simulations. Here, we introduce a substantial improvement of the metadynamics method, which finally brings simulations in close agreement with experiments. We unveil the subtle and non-intuitive stepwise mechanism of the pressure-induced transformation of fourfold-coordinated alpha-quartz into sixfold-coordinated stishovite at room temperature. We also predict that on compression fourfold-coordinated coesite will transform into the post-stishovite alpha-PbO2-type phase. The new method is far more efficient than previous methods, and for the first time the study of complex structural phase transitions with many intermediates is within the reach of molecular dynamics simulations. This insight will help in designing new experimental protocols capable of steering the system towards the desired transition.

@abstract:
 A molecular dynamics simulation approach was applied for the prediction of the thermal stability of oligonucleotide duplexes. It was shown that the enthalpy of the DNA/DNA complex formation could be calculated using this approach. We have studied the influence of various simulation parameters on the secondary structure and the hybridization enthalpy value of Dickerson-Drew dodecamer. The optimal simulation parameters for the most reliable prediction of the enthalpy values were determined. The thermodynamic parameters (enthalpy and entropy changes) of a duplex formation were obtained experimentally for 305 oligonucleotides of various lengths and GC-content. The resulting database was studied with molecular dynamics (MD) simulation using the optimized simulation parameters. Gibbs free energy changes and the melting temperatures were evaluated using the experimental correlation between enthalpy and entropy changes of the duplex formation and the enthalpy values calculated by the MD simulation. The average errors in the predictions of enthalpy, the Gibbs free energy change, and the melting temperature of oligonucleotide complexes were 11{\%}, 10{\%}, and 4.4 °C, respectively. We have shown that the molecular dynamics simulation gives a possibility to calculate the thermal stability of native DNA/DNA complexes a priori with an unexpectedly high accuracy.

 Organic functionalization of non-oxidized silicon surfaces, while allowing for robust chemical passivation of the inorganic substrate, is intended and expected to broaden the chemical, physical and electronic properties of the currently most relevant technological material. Numerous protocols are now available for the preparation of Si-C, Si-O and Si-N bound layers. In particular, the covalent attachment of 1-alkenes and 1-alkynes onto hydride-terminated Si(100) and Si(111) has seen a wealth of research activity starting from the pioneering work of Linford and Chidsey (Alkyl monolayers covalently bonded to silicon surfaces, J.

Particular emphasis is placed on discussing the reasons behind the need for novel chemical approaches that are straightforward, modular and of wide scope so as to allow the application of silicon electrodes in aqueous electrolytes.

@abstract:
 An extended electron model fully recovers many of the experimental results of quantum mechanics while it avoids many of the pitfalls and remains generally free of paradoxes. The formulation of the many-body electronic problem here resembles the Kohn-Sham formulation of standard density functional theory. However, rather than referring electronic properties to a large set of single electron orbitals, the extended electron model uses only mass density and field components, leading to a substantial increase in computational efficiency. To date, the Hohenberg-Kohn theorems have not been proved for a model of this type, nor has a universal energy functional been presented. In this paper, we address these problems and show that the Hohenberg-Kohn theorems do also hold for a density model of this type. We then present a proof-of-concept practical implementation of this method and show that it reproduces the accuracy of more widely used methods on a test-set of small atomic systems, thus paving the way for the development of fast, efficient and accurate codes on this basis.

@abstract:
 Many-body effects arise from the collective behaviour of large numbers of interacting particles, for example, electrons, and the properties of such a system cannot be understood considering only single or non-interacting particles. Despite the generality of the many-body picture, there are only a few examples of experimentally observing such effects in molecular systems. Measurements of the local density of states of single molecules by scanning tunnelling spectroscopy is usually interpreted in terms of single-particle molecular orbitals. Here, we show that the simple single-particle picture fails qualitatively to account for the resonances in the tunnelling spectra of different charge states of cobalt phthalocyanine molecules. Instead, these resonances can be understood as a series of many-body excitations of the different ground states of the molecule. Our theoretical approach opens an accessible route beyond the single-particle picture in quantifying many-body states in molecules.

 The interaction of water molecules with metal surfaces is typically weak and as a result van der Waals (vdW) forces can be expected to be of importance. Here we account for the systematic poor treatment of vdW forces in most popular density functional theory exchange-correlation functionals by applying accurate non-local vdW density functionals. We have computed the adsorption of a variety of exemplar systems including water monomer adsorption on Al(111), Cu(111), Cu(110), Ru(0001), Rh(111), Pd(111), Ag(111), Pt(111), and unreconstructed Au(111), and small clusters (up to 6 waters) on Cu(110). We show that non-local correlations contribute substantially to the water-metal bond in all systems, whilst water-water bonding is much less affected by non-local correlations. Interestingly non-local correlations contribute more to the adsorption of water on the reactive transition metal substrates than they do on the noble metals. The relative stability, adsorption sites, and adsorption geometries of competing water adstructures rarely differ when comparing results obtained with semi-local functionals and the non-local vdW density functionals, which explains the previous success of semi-local functionals in characterizing adsorbed water structures on a number of metal surfaces.

@abstract:
 Scanning tunnelling microscopy and atomic force microscopy can be used to study the electronic and structural properties of surfaces, as well as molecules and nanostructures adsorbed on surfaces, with atomic precision, but they cannot directly probe the distribution of charge in these systems. However, another form of scanning probe microscopy, Kelvin probe force microscopy, can be used to measure the local contact potential difference between the scanning probe tip and the surface, a quantity that is closely related to the charge distribution on the surface. Here, we use a combination of scanning tunnelling microscopy, atomic force microscopy and Kelvin probe force microscopy to examine naphthalocyanine molecules (which have been used as molecular switches) on a thin insulating layer of NaCl on Cu(111). We show that Kelvin probe force microscopy can map the local contact potential difference of this system with submolecular resolution, and we use density functional theory calculations to verify that these maps reflect the intramolecular distribution of charge. This approach could help to provide fundamental insights into single-molecule switching and bond formation, processes that are usually accompanied by the redistribution of charge within or between molecules.

@abstract:
 Recognition tunneling (RT) identifies target molecules trapped between tunneling electrodes functionalized with recognition molecules that serve as specific chemical linkages between the metal electrodes and the trapped target molecule. Possible applications include single molecule DNA and protein sequencing. This paper addresses several fundamental aspects of RT by multiscale theory, applying both all-atom and coarse-grained DNA models: (1) we show that the magnitude of the observed currents are consistent with the results of non-equilibrium Green's function calculations carried out on a solvated all-atom model. (2) Brownian fluctuations in hydrogen bond-lengths lead to current spikes that are similar to what is observed experimentally. (3) The frequency characteristics of these fluctuations can be used to identify the trapped molecules with a machine-learning algorithm, giving a theoretical underpinning to this new method of identifying single molecule signals.

@abstract:
 NanoCells are disordered arrays of metallic islands that are interlinked with molecules between micrometer-sized metallic input/output leads. In the past, simulations had been conducted showing that the NanoCells may function as both memory and logic devices that are programmable postfabrication. Reported here is the first assembly of a NanoCell with disordered arrays of molecules and Au islands. The assembled NanoCells exhibit reproducible switching behavior and two types of memory effects at room temperature. The switch-type memory is characteristic of a destructive read, while the conductivity-type memory features a nondestructive read. Both types of memory effects are stable for more than a week at room temperature, and bit level ratios (0:1) of the conductivity-type memory have been observed to be as high as 10(4):1 and reaching 10(6):1 upon ozone treatment, which likely destroys extraneous leakage pathways. Both molecular electronic and nanofilamentary metal switching mechanisms have been considered, though the evidence points more strongly toward the latter. The approach here demonstrates the efficacy of a disordered nanoscale array for high-yielding switching and memory while mitigating the arduous task of nanoscale patterning.

@abstract:
 An algorithm is presented which is used to recognize the similarity of crystal structures by matching a description of one structure against the equivalent descriptions of a second. Equivalent descriptions are considered since there are multiple possible ways of choosing the crystal axes and their origin, the asymmetric unit and atom numbering. Another idea used in the algorithm is to use positional and rotational parameters of the molecular fragments to describe the principal crystal structure. The two structures are considered to be similar if in such descriptions the corresponding cell parameters and the parameters of corresponding fragments differ from each other within the limits specified. As a result of such similarity searching, the type of structural similarity, including the transformation matrix of crystallographic axes and the atom correspondences, is determined. The algorithm has been put to practical use in the CRYCOM program. This program is compatible with the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) through interaction with the GEOM78 program of CSD. The latter program is also used in CRYCOM for recognizing molecular fragments. use of CRYCOM is illustrated in a few examples.

@abstract:
 The past years have witnessed remarkable advances in our use of atomic force microscopy (AFM) for stretching single biomolecules, thereby contributing to answering many outstanding questions in biophysics and chemical biology. In these single-molecule force spectroscopy (SMFS) experiments, the AFM tip is continuously approached to and retracted from the biological sample, while monitoring the interaction force. The obtained force-extension curves provide key insight into the molecular elasticity and localization of single molecules, either on isolated systems or on cellular surfaces. In this tutorial review, we describe the principle of such SMFS experiments, and we survey remarkable breakthroughs made in manipulating single polysaccharides and proteins, including understanding the conformational properties of sugars and controlling them by force, measuring the molecular elasticity of mechanical proteins, unfolding and refolding individual proteins, probing protein-ligand interactions, and tuning enzymatic reactions by force. In addition, we show how SMFS with AFM tips bearing specific bioligands has enabled researchers to stretch and localize single molecules on live cells, in relation with cellular functions.

 Sandwich structures formed by metal atoms intercalated between sp(2)-carbon planes can be found either in metal-graphite-based materials or discrete multinuclear sandwich complexes. Their reactivity, and in particular their dynamic behaviour, has recently attracted interest both from a structural and a practical aspect, for example in catalysis. However, progress in this area has been rather slow, and it remains difficult to elucidate their structure and behaviour at the molecular level. Here, we report two sandwich complexes--in which four palladium centres are incorporated between two $\pi$-conjugated ligands--which exhibit two modes of redox-switchable structural changes. In the first complex, the tetrapalladium chain is split by oxidation into two well-separated dipalladium units. This motion is reversed on reduction. In the second complex, reversible carbon-carbon coupling occurs between the ligands during the redox process.

@abstract:
 We describe a method for minimizing the lattice energy of molecular crystal structures, using a realistic anisotropic atom-atom model for the intermolecular forces. Molecules are assumed to be rigid, and the structure is described by the center of mass positions and orientational parameters for each molecule in the unit cell, as well as external strain parameters used to optimize the cell geometry. The resulting program uses a distributed multipole description of the electrostatic forces, which consists of sets of atomic multipoles (charge, dipole, quadrupole, etc.) to represent the lone pair, pi electron density, and other nonspherical features in the atomic charge distribution. Such ab initio based, electrostatic models are essential for describing the orientation dependence of the intermolecular forces, including hydrogen bonding, between polar molecules. Studies on a range of organic crystals containing hydrogen bonds are used to illustrate the use of this new crystal structure relaxation program, DMAREL, and show that it provides a promising new approach to studying the crystal packing of polar molecules.

An STM equipped with any of these sensors is able to image the short-range Pauli repulsion and thus resolve the inner structure of large organic adsorbate molecules. Differences in the performance of the three studied sensors suggest that the sensor functionality can be tailored by tuning the interaction between the sensor particle and the STM tip.

Lett. 120, 166101 (2018)PRLTAO0031-900710.1103/PhysRevLett.120.166101] by now considering a broad range of incident ion energies, thus modeling samples that span the entire range from low-density (sp2-rich) to high-density (sp3-rich, "diamondlike") amorphous forms of carbon. Two different mechanisms are observed in these simulations, depending on the impact energy: low-energy impacts induce sp- and sp2-dominated growth directly around the impact site, whereas high-energy impacts induce peening. Furthermore, we propose and apply a scheme for computing the anisotropic elastic properties of the a-C films. Our work provides fundamental insight into this intriguing class of disordered solids, as well as a conceptual and methodological blueprint for simulating the atomic-scale deposition of other materials with ML driven molecular dynamics.

@abstract:
 A combination of classical Coulomb charging, electronic level spacings, spin, and vibrational modes determines the single-electron transfer reactions through nanoscale systems connected to external electrodes by tunnelling barriers. Coulomb charging effects have been shown to dominate such transport in semiconductor quantum dots, metallic and semiconducting nanoparticles, carbon nanotubes, and single molecules. Recently, transport has been shown to be also influenced by spin--through the Kondo effect--for both nanotubes and single molecules, as well as by vibrational fine structure. Here we describe a single-electron transistor where the electronic levels of a single pi-conjugated molecule in several distinct charged states control the transport properties. The molecular electronic levels extracted from the single-electron-transistor measurements are strongly perturbed compared to those of the molecule in solution, leading to a very significant reduction of the gap between the highest occupied molecular orbital and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital. We suggest, and verify by simple model calculations, that this surprising effect could be caused by image charges generated in the source and drain electrodes resulting in a strong localization of the charges on the molecule.

@abstract:
 Over the past decade, many laboratories have begun to explore brain-computer interface (BCI) technology as a radically new communication option for those with neuromuscular impairments that prevent them from using conventional augmentative communication methods. BCI's provide these users with communication channels that do not depend on peripheral nerves and muscles. This article summarizes the first international meeting devoted to BCI research and development. Current BCI's use electroencephalographic (EEG) activity recorded at the scalp or single-unit activity recorded from within cortex to control cursor movement, select letters or icons, or operate a neuroprosthesis. The central element in each BCI is a translation algorithm that converts electrophysiological input from the user into output that controls external devices. BCI operation depends on effective interaction between two adaptive controllers, the user who encodes his or her commands in the electrophysiological input provided to the BCI, and the BCI which recognizes the commands contained in the input and expresses them in device control. Current BCI's have maximum information transfer rates of 5-25 b/min. Achievement of greater speed and accuracy depends on improvements in signal processing, translation algorithms, and user training. These improvements depend on increased interdisciplinary cooperation between neuroscientists, engineers, computer programmers, psychologists, and rehabilitation specialists, and on adoption and widespread application of objective methods for evaluating alternative methods. The practical use of BCI technology depends on the development of appropriate applications, identification of appropriate user groups, and careful attention to the needs and desires of individual users. BCI research and development will also benefit from greater emphasis on peer-reviewed publications, and from adoption of standard venues for presentations and discussion.

@abstract:
 The forces between two single molecules brought into contact, and their connection with charge transport through the molecular junction, are studied here using non contact AFM, STM, and density functional theory simulations. A carbon monoxide molecule approaching an acetylene molecule (C2H2) initially feels weak attractive electrostatic forces, partly arising from charge reorganization in the presence of molecular. We find that the molecular contact is chemically passive, and protects the electron tunneling barrier from collapsing, even in the limit of repulsive forces. However, we find subtle conductance and force variations at different contacting sites along the C2H2 molecule attributed to a weak overlap of their respective frontier orbitals.

 We assemble bistable silicon quantum dots consisting of four buckled atoms (Si4-QD) using atom manipulation.

Simultaneous application of competing current and force allows us to tune switching direction continuously.

 Singlet and triplet excited states of trans-azobenzene have been measured in the gas phase by electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS). In order to interpret the strongly overlapping singlet and triplet bands in the spectra a set of large-scale correlated quantum Monte-Carlo (QMC) simulations was performed. The EELS/QMC combination of methods yields an excellent agreement between theory and experiment and for the two low-lying excited singlet and two low-lying triplet states permitted their unambiguous assignment. In addition, EELS revealed two overlapping electronic states in the band commonly assigned as S(2), the lower one with a pronounced vibrational structure, the upper one structureless. Finally, the agreement between theory and experiment was shown to further increase by taking computationally into account the finite temperature effects.

 We present a variety of new architectural features and training procedures that we apply to the generative adversarial networks (GANs) framework. We focus on two applications of GANs: semi-supervised learning, and the generation of images that humans find visually realistic. Unlike most work on generative models, our primary goal is not to train a model that assigns high likelihood to test data, nor do we require the model to be able to learn well without using any labels. Using our new techniques, we achieve state-of-the-art results in semi-supervised classification on MNIST, CIFAR-10 and SVHN. The generated images are of high quality as confirmed by a visual Turing test: our model generates MNIST samples that humans cannot distinguish from real data, and CIFAR-10 samples that yield a human error rate of 21.3{\%}. We also present ImageNet samples with unprecedented resolution and show that our methods enable the model to learn recognizable features of ImageNet classes.

 Optical gain at 1.54 $\mu$m in erbium-doped silicon-rich silicon oxide (SRSO) is demonstrated. Er-doped SRSO thin film was fabricated by electron-cyclotron resonance enhanced chemical vapor deposition of silicon suboxide with concurrent sputtering of erbium followed by a 5 min anneal at 1000 ° C . Ridge-type single mode waveguides were fabricated by wet chemical etching. Optical gain of 4 dB/cm of an externally coupled signal at 1.54 $\mu$m is observed when the Er is excited via carriers generated in the Si nanoclusters by the 477 nm line of an Ar laser incident on the top of the waveguide at a pump power of 1.5  W cm −2 .

@abstract:
 Modeling non-adiabatic phenomena and materials at extremes has been a long-standing challenge for computational chemistry and materials science, particularly for systems that undergo irreversible phase transformations due to significant electronic excitations. Ab initio and existing quantum mechanics approximations to the Schr{\"{o}}dinger equation have been limited to ground-state descriptions or few excited electronic states, less than 100 atoms, and sub-picosecond timescales of dynamics evolution. Recently, the electron force field (eFF) introduced by Su and Goddard (2007) presented a cost-efficient alternative to describe the dynamics of electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom. eFF describes an N-electron wave function as a Hartree product of one-electron floating spherical Gaussian wave packets propagating via the time-dependent Schr{\"{o}}dinger equation under a mixed quantum-classical Hamiltonian evaluated as sum of self- and pairwise potential interactions. Local Pauli potential corrections replace the need for explicit anti-symmetrization of total electronic wavefunction, a wavefunction kinetic energy term accounts for Heisenberg's uncertainty, and classical electrostatics complete the total eFF energy expression. However, due to the spherical symmetry of the underlying Gaussian basis functions, the original eFF formulation is limited to low-Z numbers with electrons of predominant s-character. To overcome this, we introduce here a formal set of potential form extensions that enable accurate description of p-block elements in the periodic table. The extensions consist of a model representing the core electrons of an atom together with the nucleus as a single pseudo particle with wave-like behavior, interacting with valence electrons, nuclei, and other cores through effective core pseudopotentials (ECPs). We demonstrate and validate the ECP extensions for complex bonding structures, geometries and energetics of systems with p-block character (containing silicon, oxygen, carbon, or aluminum atoms and combination thereof) and apply them to study materials under extreme mechanical loading conditions.

@abstract:
 For decades, conventional computers based on the von Neumann architecture have performed computation by repeatedly transferring data between their processing and their memory units, which are physically separated. As computation becomes increasingly data-centric and as the scalability limits in terms of performance and power are being reached, alternative computing paradigms are searched for in which computation and storage are collocated. A fascinating new approach is that of computational memory where the physics of nanoscale memory devices are used to perform certain computational tasks within the memory unit in a non-von Neumann manner. Here we present a large-scale experimental demonstration using one million phase-change memory devices organized to perform a high-level computational primitive by exploiting the crystallization dynamics. Also presented is an application of such a computational memory to process real-world data-sets. The results show that this co-existence of computation and storage at the nanometer scale could be the enabler for new, ultra-dense, low power, and massively parallel computing systems.

@abstract:
 Advances in self-assembly over the past decade have demonstrated that nano- and microscale particles can be organized into a large diversity of ordered three-dimensional (3D) lattices. However, the ability to generate different desired lattice types from the same set of particles remains challenging. Here, we show that nanoparticles can be assembled into crystalline and open 3D frameworks by connecting them through designed DNA-based polyhedral frames. The geometrical shapes of the frames, combined with the DNA-assisted binding properties of their vertices, facilitate the well-defined topological connections between particles in accordance with frame geometry. With this strategy, different crystallographic lattices using the same particles can be assembled by introduction of the corresponding DNA polyhedral frames. This approach should facilitate the rational assembly of nanoscale lattices through the design of the unit cell.

@abstract:
 The bistability in the position of the two hydrogen atoms in the inner cavity of single free-base naphthalocyanine molecules constitutes a two-level system that was manipulated and probed by low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy. When adsorbed on an ultrathin insulating film, the molecules can be switched in a controlled fashion between the two states by excitation induced by the inelastic tunneling current. The tautomerization reaction can be probed by resonant tunneling through the molecule and is expressed as considerable changes in the conductivity of the molecule. We also demonstrated a coupling of the switching process so that the charge injection in one molecule induced tautomerization in an adjacent molecule.

 A method is presented that can find the global minimum of very complex condensed matter systems. It is based on the simple principle of exploring the configurational space as fast as possible and of avoiding revisiting known parts of this space. Even though it is not a genetic algorithm, it is not based on thermodynamics. The efficiency of the method depends strongly on the type of moves that are used to hop into new local minima. Moves that find low-barrier escape-paths out of the present minimum generally lead into low energy minima.

By use of this routine a strong distance dependence of the averaging effect is revealed. A combination of KPFS experiments and FEM simulations is applied to quantify the averaging effect, which simpliﬁes comparison among different experiments and to theory. No inﬂuence of surface topography on the averaging effect was observed.

@abstract:
 Tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS) is a versatile tool for chemical analysis at the nanoscale. In earlier TERS experiments, Raman modes with components parallel to the tip were studied based on the strong electric field enhancement along the tip. Perpendicular modes were usually neglected. Here, we investigate an isolated copper naphthalocyanine molecule adsorbed on a triple-layer NaCl on Ag(111) using scanning tunnelling microscope TERS imaging. For flat-lying molecules on NaCl, the Raman images present different patterns depending on the symmetry of the vibrational mode. Our results reveal that components of the electric field perpendicular to the tip should be considered aside from the parallel components. Moreover, under resonance excitation conditions, the perpendicular components can play a substantial role in the enhancement. This single-molecule study in a well-defined environment provides insights into the Raman process at the plasmonic nanocavity, which may be useful in the nanoscale metrology of various molecular systems.

 The metadynamics or hills method is a relatively new molecular dynamics technique aimed to enhance the sampling of separated regions in phase space and map out the underlying free energy landscape as a function of a small number of order parameters or collective variables. The high efficiency allows for the application of metadynamics in combination with first principles dynamics methods, in particular with Car-Parrinello molecular dynamics, to study processes in which changes in the electronic structure play a dominant role, such as chemical reactions. The option to choose several independent collective variables is important to tackle complex and concerted transformations that lack an obvious a priori choice for a single reaction coordinate. In this Account, we discuss the role of metadynamics in the search of transition states, local minima, reaction paths, free energy profiles, and reaction coordinates among a growing list of alternative methods.

 We propose genetic algorithms, which are robust optimization techniques inspired by natural selection, to enhance the versatility of digital quantum simulations. In this sense, we show that genetic algorithms can be employed to increase the fidelity and optimize the resource requirements of digital quantum simulation protocols, while adapting naturally to the experimental constraints. Furthermore, this method allows us to reduce not only digital errors, but also experimental errors in quantum gates. Indeed, by adding ancillary qubits, we design a modular gate made out of imperfect gates, whose fidelity is larger than the fidelity of any of the constituent gates. Finally, we prove that the proposed modular gates are resilient against different gate errors.

 Large-grain high-temperature superconductors of the form RE-Ba-Cu-O (where RE is a rare-earth element) can trap magnetic fields of several tesla at low temperatures, and so can be used for permanent magnet applications. The magnitude of the trapped field is proportional to the critical current density and the volume of the superconductor. Various potential engineering applications for such magnets have emerged, and some have already been commercialized. However, the range of applications is limited by poor mechanical stability and low thermal conductivity of the bulk superconductors; RE-Ba-Cu-O magnets have been found to fracture during high-field activation, owing to magnetic pressure. Here we present a post-fabrication treatment that improves the mechanical properties as well as thermal conductivity of a bulk Y-Ba-Cu-O magnet, thereby increasing its field-trapping capacity. First, resin impregnation and wrapping the materials in carbon fibre improves the mechanical properties. Second, a small hole drilled into the centre of the magnet allows impregnation of Bi-Pb-Sn-Cd alloy into the superconductor and inclusion of an aluminium wire support, which results in a significant enhancement of thermal stability and internal mechanical strength. As a result, 17.24 T could be trapped, without fracturing, in a bulk Y-Ba-Cu-O sample of 2.65 cm diameter at 29 K.

@abstract:
 Biological materials are self-assembled with near-atomic precision in living cells, whereas synthetic 3D structures generally lack such precision and controllability. Recently, DNA nanotechnology, especially DNA origami technology, has been useful in the bottom-up fabrication of well-defined nanostructures ranging from tens of nanometres to sub-micrometres. In this Primer, we summarize the methodologies of DNA origami technology, including origami design, synthesis, functionalization and characterization. We highlight applications of origami structures in nanofabrication, nanophotonics and nanoelectronics, catalysis, computation, molecular machines, bioimaging, drug delivery and biophysics. We identify challenges for the field, including size limits, stability issues and the scale of production, and discuss their possible solutions. We further provide an outlook on next-generation DNA origami techniques that will allow in vivo synthesis and multiscale manufacturing.

@abstract:
 The construction of electronic devices from single molecular building blocks, which possess certain functions such as switching or rectifying and are connected by atomic-scale wires on a supporting surface, is an essential goal of molecular electronics. A key challenge is the controlled assembly of molecules into desired architectures by strong, that is, covalent, intermolecular connections, enabling efficient electron transport between the molecules and providing high stability. However, no molecular networks on surfaces 'locked' by covalent interactions have been reported so far. Here, we show that such covalently bound molecular nanostructures can be formed on a gold surface upon thermal activation of porphyrin building blocks and their subsequent chemical reaction at predefined connection points. We demonstrate that the topology of these nanostructures can be precisely engineered by controlling the chemical structure of the building blocks. Our results represent a versatile route for future bottom-up construction of sophisticated electronic circuits and devices, based on individual functionalized molecules.

@abstract:
 Silicon nanocrystals (Si NCs) are attractive functional materials. They are compatible with standard electronics and communications platforms and are biocompatible. Numerous methods have been developed to realize size-controlled Si NC synthesis. While these procedures produce Si NCs that appear identical, their optical responses can differ dramatically. Si NCs prepared using high-temperature methods routinely exhibit photoluminescence agreeing with the effective mass approximation (EMA), while those prepared via solution methods exhibit blue emission that is somewhat independent of particle size. Despite many proposals, a definitive explanation for this difference has been elusive for no less than a decade. This apparent dichotomy brings into question our understanding of Si NC properties and potentially limits the scope of their application. The present contribution takes a substantial step forward toward identifying the origin of the blue emission that is not expected based upon EMA predictions. It describes a detailed comparison of Si NCs obtained from three of the most widely cited procedures as well as the conversion of red-emitting Si NCs to blue emitters upon exposure to nitrogen-containing reagents. Analysis of the evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that the presence of trace nitrogen and oxygen even at the parts per million level in Si NCs gives rise to the blue emission.

@abstract:
 The CCSD(T) method stands out among various coupled-cluster (CC) approximations as the "golden standard" in computational chemistry and is widely and successfully used in the realm of covalent and noncovalent interactions. The CCSD(T) method provides reliable interaction energies, but their surprising accuracy is believed to arise partially from an error compensation. The convergence of the CC expansion has been investigated up to fully iterative pentuple excitations (CCSDTQP); for the smallest eight electron complexes, the full CI calculations have also been performed. We conclude that the convergence of interaction energy at noncovalent accuracy (0.01 kcal/mol) for the complexes studied is reached already at CCSDTQ or CCSDT(Q) levels. When even higher accuracy (spectroscopic accuracy of 1 cm-1, or 3 cal/mol) is required, then the noniterative CCSDTQ(P) method could be used. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Chemical Society.

@abstract:
 A series of edge-selectively halogenated (X = Cl, Br, I) graphene nanoplatelets (XGnPs = ClGnP, BrGnP, IGnP) were prepared simply by ball-milling graphite in the presence of Cl2, Br2 and I2, respectively. High BET surface areas of 471, 579 and 662 m(2)/g were observed for ClGnP, BrGnP and IGnP, respectively, indicating a significant extent of delamination during the ball-milling and subsequent workup processes. The newly-developed XGnPs can be well dispersed in various solvents, and hence are solution processable. Furthermore, XGnPs showed remarkable electrocatalytic activities toward oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) with a high selectivity, good tolerance to methanol crossover/CO poisoning effects, and excellent long-term cycle stability. First-principle density-functional calculations revealed that halogenated graphene edges could provide decent adsorption sites for oxygen molecules, in a good agreement with the experimental observations.

@abstract:
 Obtaining the exciton dynamics of large photosynthetic complexes by using mixed quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) is computationally demanding. We propose a machine learning technique, multi-layer perceptrons, as a tool to reduce the time required to compute excited state energies. With this approach we predict time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) excited state energies of bacteriochlorophylls in the Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) complex. Additionally we compute spectral densities and exciton populations from the predictions. Different methods to determine multi-layer perceptron training sets are introduced, leading to several initial data selections. In addition, we compute spectral densities and exciton populations. Once multi-layer perceptrons are trained, predicting excited state energies was found to be significantly faster than the corresponding QM/MM calculations. We showed that multi-layer perceptrons can successfully reproduce the energies of QM/MM calculations to a high degree of accuracy with prediction errors contained within 0.01 eV (0.5{\%}). Spectral densities and exciton dynamics are also in agreement with the TDDFT results. The acceleration and accurate prediction of dynamics strongly encourage the combination of machine learning techniques with ab-initio methods.

@abstract:
 The computer simulation of condensed systems is a challenging task. While electronic structure methods like density-functional theory (DFT) usually provide a good compromise between accuracy and eﬃciency, they are computationally very demanding and thus applicable only to systems containing up to a few hundred atoms. Unfortunately, many interesting problems require simulations to be performed on much larger systems involving thousands of atoms or more. Consequently, more eﬃcient methods are urgently needed, and a lot of eﬀort has been spent on the development of a large variety of potentials enabling simulations with signiﬁcantly extended time and length scales. Most commonly, these potentials are based on physically motivated functional forms and thus perform very well for the applications they have been designed for. On the other hand, they are often highly system-speciﬁc and thus cannot easily be transferred from one system to another. Moreover, their numerical accuracy is restricted by the intrinsic limitations of the imposed functional forms. In recent years, several novel types of potentials have emerged, which are not based on physical considerations. Instead, they aim to reproduce a set of reference electronic structure data as accurately as possible by using very general and ﬂexible functional forms. In this review we will survey a number of these methods. While they diﬀer in the choice of the employed mathematical functions, they all have in common that they provide high-quality potential-energy surfaces, while the eﬃciency is comparable to conventional empirical potentials. It has been demonstrated that in many cases these potentials now oﬀer a very interesting new approach to study complex systems with hitherto unreached accuracy.

@abstract:
 In this work, we demonstrate that semiempirical quantum chemical calculations can be accelerated significantly by leveraging the graphics processing unit (GPU) as a coprocessor on a hybrid multicore CPU-GPU computing platform. Semiempirical calculations using the MNDO, AM1, PM3, OM1, OM2, and OM3 model Hamiltonians were systematically profiled for three types of test systems (fullerenes, water clusters, and solvated crambin) to identify the most time-consuming sections of the code. The corresponding routines were ported to the GPU and optimized employing both existing library functions and a GPU kernel that carries out a sequence of noniterative Jacobi transformations during pseudodiagonalization. The overall computation times for single-point energy calculations and geometry optimizations of large molecules were reduced by one order of magnitude for all methods, as compared to runs on a single CPU core. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Chemical Society.

@abstract:
 The design of artificial catalysts able to compete with the catalytic proficiency of enzymes is an intense subject of research. Non-covalent interactions are thought to be involved in several properties of enzymatic catalysis, notably (i) the confinement of the substrates and the active site within a catalytic pocket, (ii) the creation of a hydrophobic pocket in water, (iii) self-replication properties and (iv) allosteric properties. The origins of the enhanced rates and high catalytic selectivities associated with these properties are still a matter of debate. Stabilisation of the transition state and favourable conformations of the active site and the product(s) are probably part of the answer. We present here artificial catalysts and biomacromolecule hybrid catalysts which constitute good models towards the development of truly competitive artificial enzymes.

 Charged particles such as hydrated ions and transient hydrated electrons, the simplest anionic reducing agents in water, and the special hydronium and hydroxide ions at water interfaces play an important role in many fields of science, such as atmospheric chemistry, radiation chemistry, and biology, as well as biochemistry. This article focuses on these species near hydrophobic interfaces of water, such as the air or vacuum interface of water or water protein/membrane interfaces. Ions at interfaces as well as solvated electrons have been reviewed frequently during the past decade. Although all species have been known for some time with seemingly familiar features, recently the picture in all cases became increasingly diffuse rather than clearer. The current account gives a critical state-of-the art overview of what is known and what remains to be understood and investigated about hydrated interfacial ions and electrons.

@abstract:
 This paper presents the fundamental principles underlying tabu search as a strategy for combinatorial optimization problems. Tabu search has achieved impressive practical successes in applications ranging from scheduling and computer channel balancing to cluster analysis and space planning, and more recently has demonstrated its value in treating classical problems such as the traveling salesman and graph coloring problems. Nevertheless, the approach is still in its infancy, and a good deal remains to be discovered about its most effective forms of implementation and about the range of problems for which it is best suited. This paper undertakes to present the major ideas and findings to date, and to indicate challenges for future research. Part I of this study indicates the basic principles, ranging from the short-term memory process at the core of the search to the intermediate and long term memory processes for intensifying and diversifying the search. Included are illustrative data structures for implementing the tabu conditions (and associated aspiration criteria) that underlie these processes. Part I concludes with a discussion of probabilistic tabu search and a summary of computational experience for a variety of applications. Part II of this study (to appear in a subsequent issue) examines more advanced considerations, applying the basic ideas to special settings and outlining a dynamic move structure to insure finiteness. Part II also describes tabu search methods for solving mixed integer programming problems and gives a brief summary of additional practical experience, including the use of tabu search to guide other types of processes, such as those of neural networks.

@abstract:
 We calculate the electronic and transport properties of a series of metalloporphyrin molecules sandwiched between gold electrodes using a combination of density functional theory and scattering theory. The impact of strong correlations at the central metallic atom is gauged by comparing our results obtained using conventional DFT andDFT + U approaches. The zero- and finite-bias transport properties may or may not show spin-filtering behavior, depending on the nature of the d state closest to the Fermi energy. The type of d state depends on the metallic atom and gives rise to interference effects that produce different Fano features. The inclusion of the U term opens a gap between the d states and changes the conductance and spin-filtering behavior qualitatively in some of the molecules. We explain the origin of the quantum interference effects found as due to the symmetry-dependent coupling between the d states and other molecular orbitals and propose the use of these systems as nanoscale chemical sensors. We also demonstrate that an adequate treatment of strong correlations is really necessary to correctly describe the transport properties of metalloporphyrins and similar molecular magnets.

 A method is presented that can find the global minimum of very complex condensed matter systems. It is based on the simple principle of exploring the configurational space as fast as possible and of avoiding revisiting known parts of this space. Even though it is not a genetic algorithm, it is not based on thermodynamics. The efficiency of the method depends strongly on the type of moves that are used to hop into new local minima. Moves that find low-barrier escape-paths out of the present minimum lead generally into low energy minima.

@abstract:
 A sudden transition in a system from an inanimate state to the living state-defined on the basis of present day living organisms-would constitute a highly unlikely event hardly predictable from physical laws. From this uncontroversial idea, a self-consistent representation of the origin of life process is built up, which is based on the possibility of a series of intermediate stages. This approach requires a particular kind of stability for these stages-dynamic kinetic stability (DKS)-which is not usually observed in regular chemistry, and which is reflected in the persistence of entities capable of self-reproduction. The necessary connection of this kinetic behaviour with far-from-equilibrium thermodynamic conditions is emphasized and this leads to an evolutionary view for the origin of life in which multiplying entities must be associated with the dissipation of free energy. Any kind of entity involved in this process has to pay the energetic cost of irreversibility, but, by doing so, the contingent emergence of new functions is made feasible. The consequences of these views on the studies of processes by which life can emerge are inferred.

@abstract:
 While graphene has attracted significant attention from the research community due to its high charge carrier mobility, important issues remain unresolved that prevent its widespread use in technologically significant applications such as digital electronics. For example, the chemical inertness of graphene hinders integration with other materials, and the lack of a bandgap implies poor switching characteristics in transistors. The formation of ordered organic monolayers on graphene has the potential to address each of these challenges. In particular, functional groups incorporated into the constituent molecules enable tailored chemical reactivity, while molecular-scale ordering within the monolayer provides sub-2 nm templates with the potential to tune the electronic band structure of graphene via quantum confinement effects. Toward these ends, we report here the formation of well-defined one-dimensional organic nanostructures on epitaxial graphene via the self-assembly of 10,12-pentacosadiynoic acid (PCDA) in ultrahigh vacuum (UHV). Molecular resolution UHV scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) images confirm the one-dimensional ordering of the as-deposited PCDA monolayer and show domain boundaries with symmetry consistent with the underlying graphene lattice. In an effort to further stabilize the monolayer, in situ ultraviolet photopolymerization induces covalent bonding between neighboring PCDA molecules in a manner that maintains one-dimensional ordering as verified by UHV STM and ambient atomic force microscopy (AFM). Further quantitative insights into these experimental observations are provided by semiempirical quantum chemistry calculations that compare the molecular structure before and after photopolymerization.

@abstract:
 The mechanical properties of bulk metallic glasses (BMGs) and their composites have been under intense investigation for many years, owing to their unique combination of high strength and elastic limit. However, because of their highly localized deformation mechanism, BMGs are typically considered to be brittle materials and are not suitable for structural applications. Recently, highly-toughened BMG composites have been created in a Zr-Ti-based system with mechanical properties comparable with high-performance crystalline alloys. In this work, we present a series of low-density, Ti-based BMG composites with combinations of high strength, tensile ductility, and excellent fracture toughness.

@abstract:
 A new computational model for Sodium Chloride, the NaCl/{\{}$\backslash$epsilon{\}}, is proposed. The Force Fields employed here for the description of the NaCl is based on a set of radial particle-particle pair potentials involving Lennard-Jones (LJ) and Coulombic forces. The parameterization is obtained fitting the density of the crystal and the density and the dielectric constant of the mixture of salt with water at diluted solution. Our model shows good agreement with the experimental values for the density and surface tension for the pure system and for the density, the viscosity, the diffusion, and the dielectric constant for the mixture with water at various molal concentrations. The NaCl/{\{}$\backslash$epsilon{\}} together with the water TIP4P/{\{}$\backslash$epsilon{\}} model provide a good approximation for studying electrolyte solutions.

@abstract:
 Self-assembly is a phenomenon observed in nature at all scales where autonomous entities build complex structures, without external influences nor centralised master plan. Modelling such entities and programming correct interactions among them is crucial for controlling the manufacture of desired complex structures at the molecular and supramolecular scale. This work focuses on a programmability model for non DNA-based molecules and complex behaviour analysis of their self-assembled conformations. In particular, we look into modelling, programming and simulation of porphyrin molecules self-assembly and apply Kolgomorov complexity-based techniques to classify and assess simulation results in terms of information content. The analysis focuses on phase transition, clustering, variability and parameter discovery which as a whole pave the way to the notion of complex systems programmability. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

@abstract:
 The "Swiss army knife" composite density functional electronic-structure method r2SCAN-3c (J. Chem. Phys. 2021, 154, 064103) is extended and optimized for the use with Slater-type orbital basis sets. The meta generalized-gradient approximation (meta-GGA) functional r2SCAN by Furness et al. is combined with a tailor-made polarized triple-$\zeta$ Slater-type atomic orbital (STO) basis set (mTZ2P), the semiclassical London dispersion correction (D4), and a geometrical counterpoise (gCP) correction. Relativistic effects are treated explicitly with the scalar-relativistic zeroth-order regular approximation (SR-ZORA). The performance of the new implementation is assessed on eight geometry and 74 energy benchmark sets, including the extensive GMTKN55 database as well as recent sets such as ROST61 and IONPI19. In geometry optimizations, the STO-based r2SCAN-3c is either on par with or more accurate than the hybrid density functional approximation M06-2X-D3(0)/TZP. In energy calculations, the overall accuracy is similar to the original implementation of r2SCAN-3c with Gaussian-type atomic orbitals (GTO), but basic properties, intermolecular noncovalent interactions, and barrier heights are better described with the STO approach, resulting in a lower weighted mean absolute deviation (WTMAD-2(STO) = 7.15 vs 7.50 kcal mol-1 with the original method) for the GMTKN55 database. The STO-optimized r2SCAN-3c outperforms many conventional hybrid/QZ approaches in most common applications at a fraction of their cost. The reliable, robust, and accurate r2SCAN-3c implementation with STOs is a promising alternative to the original implementation with GTOs and can be generally used for a broad field of quantum chemical problems.

 Catalyst-free vertically aligned graphene nanoflakes possessing a large amount of high density edge planes were functionalized using nitrogen species in a low energy N(+) ion bombardment process to achieve pyridinic, cyanide and nitrogen substitution in hexagonal graphitic coordinated units. The evolution of the electronic structure of the functionalized graphene nanoflakes over the temperature range 20-800 °C was investigated in situ, using high resolution x-ray photoemission spectroscopy. We demonstrate that low energy irradiation is a useful tool for achieving nitrogen doping levels up to 9.6 at.{\%}. Pyridinic configurations are found to be predominant at room temperature, while at 800 °C graphitic nitrogen configurations become the dominant ones. The findings have helped to provide an understanding of the thermal stability of nitrogen functionalities in graphene, and offer prospects for controllable tuning of nitrogen doping in device applications.

 Atomic force microscopy is capable of resolving the chemical structure of a single molecule on a surface. In previous research, such high resolution has only been obtained at low temperatures. Here we demonstrate that the chemical structure of a single molecule can be clearly revealed even at room temperature. 3,4,9,10-perylene tetracarboxylic dianhydride, which is strongly adsorbed onto a corner-hole site of a Si(111)-(7 × 7) surface in a bridge-like configuration is used for demonstration. Force spectroscopy combined with first-principle calculations clarifies that chemical structures can be resolved independent of tip reactivity. We show that the submolecular contrast over a central part of the molecule is achieved in the repulsive regime due to differences in the attractive van der Waals interaction and the Pauli repulsive interaction between different sites of the molecule.

@abstract:
 We propose an approach that combines an extraction of collective motions of a molecular system with a sampling of its free energy surface. A recently introduced method of metadynamics allows exploration of the free energy surface of a molecular system by means of coarse-grained dynamics with flooding of free energy minima. This free energy surface is defined as a function of a set of collective variables (e.g., interatomic distances, angles, torsions, and others). In this study, essential coordinates determined by essential dynamics (principle component analysis) were used as collective variables in metadynamics. First, dynamics of the model system (explicitly solvated alanine dipeptide, Ace-Ala-Nme) was simulated by a classical molecular dynamics simulation. The trajectory (1 ns) was then analyzed by essential dynamics to obtain essential coordinates. The free energy surface as a function of the first and second essential coordinates was then explored by metadynamics. The resulting free energy surface is in agreement with other studies of this system. We propose that a combination of these two methods (metadynamics and essential dynamics) has great potential in studies of conformational changes in peptides and proteins.

@abstract:
 Water clusters have attracted a lot of attention as prototype systems to study hydrogen bonded molecular aggregates but also to gain deeper insights into the properties of liquid water, the solvent of life. All these studies depend on an accurate description of the atomic interactions and countless potentials have been proposed in the literature in the past decades to represent the potential-energy surface (PES) of water. Many of these potentials employ drastic approximations like rigid water monomers and fixed point charges, while on the other hand also several attempts have been made to derive very accurate PESs by fitting data obtained in high-level electronic structure calculations. In recent years artificial neural networks (NNs) have been established as a powerful tool to construct high-dimensional PESs of a variety of systems, but to date no full-dimensional NN PES for water has been reported. Here, we present NN potentials for water clusters containing two to six water molecules trained to density functional theory (DFT) data employing two different exchange-correlation functionals, PBE and RPBE. In contrast to other potentials fitted to first principles data, these NN potentials are not based on a truncated many-body expansion of the energy but consider the interactions between all water molecules explicitly. For both functionals an excellent agreement with the underlying DFT calculations has been found with binding energy errors of only about 1{\%}.

@abstract:
 We describe the synthesis of a novel biphenyl azobenzene derivative exhibiting: (i) a protected thiol anchoring group in the [small alpha]-position to readily form self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) on Au surfaces; and (ii) a terminal perfluorinated benzene ring in the [small omega]-position to modify the surface properties. The design of this molecule ensured both an efficient in situ photoswitching between the trans and cis isomers when chemisorbed on Au(111), due to the presence of a biphenyl bridge between the thiol protected anchoring group and the azo dye, and a significant variation of the work function of the SAM in the two isomeric states, induced by the perfluorinated phenyl head group. By exploiting the light responsive nature of the chemisorbed molecules, it is possible to dynamically modify in situ the work function of the SAM-covered electrode, as demonstrated both experimentally and by quantum-chemical calculations, revealing changes in work function up to 220 meV. These findings are relevant for tuning the work function of metallic electrodes, and hence to dynamically modulate charge injection at metal-semiconductor interfaces for organic opto-electronic applications.

@abstract:
 Advances in tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS) have demonstrated ultrahigh spatial resolution so that the vibrational modes of individual molecules can be visualized. The spatial resolution of TERS is determined by the confinement of the plasmon-induced field in the junction; however, the conditions necessary for achieving the high spatial confinement required for imaging individual molecules are not fully understood. Here, we present a systematic theoretical study of TERS imaging of single molecules, using a hybrid atomistic electrodynamics-quantum mechanical method. This approach provides a consistent treatment of the molecule and the plasmonic near field under conditions where they cannot be treated separately. In our simulations, we demonstrate that TERS is capable of resolving intricate molecule vibrations with atomic resolution, although we find that TERS images are extremely sensitive to the near field in the junction. Achieving the atomic resolution requires the near field to be confined within a few {\aa}ngstroms in diameter and the near-field focal plane to be in the molecule plane. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the traditional surface selection rule of Raman spectroscopy is altered due to the significant field confinement that leads to significant field-gradient effects in the Raman scattering. This work provides insights into single-molecule imaging based on TERS and Raman scattering of molecules in nanojunctions with atomic dimensions.

 How electronic charge is distributed over a molecule determines to a large extent its chemical properties. Here, we demonstrate how the electrostatic force field, originating from the inhomogeneous charge distribution in a molecule, can be measured with submolecular resolution. We exploit the fact that distortions typically observed in high-resolution atomic force microscopy images are for a significant part caused by the electrostatic force acting between charges of the tip and the molecule of interest. By finding a geometrical transformation between two high-resolution AFM images acquired with two different tips, the electrostatic force field or potential over individual molecules and self-assemblies thereof can be reconstructed with submolecular resolution.

@abstract:
 This issue of PNAS features “nonequilibrium transport and mixing across interfaces,” with several papers describing the nonequilibrium coupling of transport at interfaces, including mesoscopic and macroscopic dynamics in fluids, plasma, and other materials over scales from microscale to celestial. Most such descriptions describe the materials in terms of the density and equations of state rather than specific atomic structures and chemical processes. It is at interfacial boundaries where such atomistic information is most relevant. However, there is not yet a practical way to couple these phenomena with the atomistic description of chemistry. The starting point for including such information is the quantum mechanics (QM). However, practical QM calculations are limited to a hundred atoms for dozens of picoseconds, far from the scales required to inform the continuum level with the proper atomistic description. To bridge this enormous gap, we need to develop practical methods to extend the scale of the atomistic simulation by several orders of magnitude while retaining the level of QM accuracy in describing the chemical process. These developments would enable continuum modeling of turbulent transport at interfaces to incorporate the relevant chemistry. In this perspective, we will focus on recent progress in accomplishing these extensions in first principles-based atomistic simulations and the strategies being pursued to increase the accuracy of very large scales while dramatically decreasing the computational effort.

 The fascinating advances in single atom/molecule manipulation with a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) tip allow scientists to fabricate atomic-scale structures or to probe chemical and physical properties of matters at an atomic level. Owing to these advances, it has become possible for the basic chemical reaction steps, such as dissociation, diffusion, adsorption, readsorption, and bond-formation processes, to be performed by using the STM tip. Complete sequences of chemical reactions are able to induce at a single-molecule level. New molecules can be constructed from the basic molecular building blocks on a one-molecule-at-a-time basis by using a variety of STM manipulation schemes in a systematic step-by-step manner. These achievements open up entirely new opportunities in nanochemistry and nanochemical technology. In this review, various STM manipulation techniques useful in the single-molecule reaction process are reviewed, and their impact on the future of nanoscience and technology are discussed.

@abstract:
 We outline details about an extension of the tight-binding (TB) approach to improve total energies, forces, and transferability. The method is based on a second-order expansion of the Kohn-Sham total energy in density-functional theory (DFT) with respect to charge density fluctuations. The zeroth order approach is equivalent to a common standard non-self-consistent (TB) scheme, while at second order a transparent, parameter-free, and readily calculable expression for generalized Hamiltonian matrix elements may be derived. These are modified by a self-consistent redistribution of Mulliken charges (SCC). Besides the usual "band structure" and shea-range repulsive terms the final approximate Kohn-Sham energy additionally includes a Coulomb interaction between charge fluctuations. At large distances this accounts for long-range electrostatic forces between two point charges and approximately includes self-interaction contributions of a given atom if the charges are located at one and the same atom. We apply the new SCC scheme to problems where deficiencies within the non-SCC standard TB approach become obvious. We thus considerably improve transferability.

@abstract:
 {\textless}p{\textgreater}The reactive force-field (ReaxFF) interatomic potential is a powerful computational tool for exploring, developing and optimizing material properties. Methods based on the principles of quantum mechanics (QM), while offering valuable theoretical guidance at the electronic level, are often too computationally intense for simulations that consider the full dynamic evolution of a system. Alternatively, empirical interatomic potentials that are based on classical principles require significantly fewer computational resources, which enables simulations to better describe dynamic processes over longer timeframes and on larger scales. Such methods, however, typically require a predefined connectivity between atoms, precluding simulations that involve reactive events. The ReaxFF method was developed to help bridge this gap. Approaching the gap from the classical side, ReaxFF casts the empirical interatomic potential within a bond-order formalism, thus implicitly describing chemical bonding without expensive QM calculations. This article provides an overview of the development, application, and future directions of the ReaxFF method.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}

@abstract:
 Self-replication is a capacity common to every species of living thing, and simple physical intuition dictates that such a process must invariably be fueled by the production of entropy. Here, we undertake to make this intuition rigorous and quantitative by deriving a lower bound for the amount of heat that is produced during a process of self-replication in a system coupled to a thermal bath. We find that the minimum value for the physically allowed rate of heat production is determined by the growth rate, internal entropy, and durability of the replicator, and we discuss the implications of this finding for bacterial cell division, as well as for the pre-biotic emergence of self-replicating nucleic acids.

The method is tested by accurately reproducing the dimensions of the B-DNA crystal structure. Importantly, intramolecular variations in groove depth of the DNA double helix are resolved, which would be inaccessible for methods that rely on ensemble-averaging.

@abstract:
 We review some recently published methods to represent atomic neighbourhood environments, and analyse their relative merits in terms of their faithfulness and suitability for fitting potential energy surfaces. The crucial properties that such representations (sometimes called descriptors) must have are differentiability with respect to moving the atoms, and invariance to the basic symmetries of physics: rotation, reflection, translation, and permutation of atoms of the same species. We demonstrate that certain widely used descriptors that initially look quite different are specific cases of a general approach, in which a finite set of basis functions with increasing angular wave numbers are used to expand the atomic neighbourhood density function. Using the example system of small clusters, we quantitatively show that this expansion needs to be carried to higher and higher wave numbers as the number of neighbours increases in order to obtain a faithful representation, and that variants of the descriptors converge at very different rates. We also propose an altogether new approach, called Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions (SOAP), that sidesteps these difficulties by directly defining the similarity between any two neighbourhood environments, and show that it is still closely connected to the invariant descriptors. We test the performance of the various representations by fitting models to the potential energy surface of small silicon clusters and the bulk crystal.

@url:      https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article/562288
@abstract:
 The amino group in the nucleic acid bases frequently interacts with other bases or with other molecular systems. Thus any nonplanarity of the amino group may affect the molecular recognition of nucleic acids. Ab initio Hartree-Fock (HF) and second-order M{\o}ller-Plesset perturbation (MP2) levels of theory have been used to obtain the equilibrium geometries of the Cl and Cs structures for five common nucleic acid bases. The energy barriers between the Cl and Cs structures have also been predicted. A series of correlation consistent basis sets up to cc-pCVQZ and aug-cc-pVQZ has been used to systematically study the dependence of the amino group nonplanarity. The equilibrium geometries of the nucleic acid bases with an amino group, including adenine, guanine, and cytosine, are examined carefully. At the MP2 level of theory, larger basis sets decrease the extent of nonplanarity of the amino group, but the decrease slows down when the QZ basis sets are used, demonstrating the intrinsic property of nonplanarity for guanine. For adenine and cytosine the situation is less clear; as the HF limit is approached, these two structures become planar. Addition of core correlation effects or diffuse functions further decreases the degree of nucleic acid base nonplanarity, in comparison to the original cc-pVXZ (X=D, T, and Q) basis sets. The aug-cc-pVXZ basis shows smaller degrees of nonplanarity than the cc-pCVXZ sets. The aug-cc-pVXZ basis is less size dependent than the cc-pVXZ and cc-pCVXZ sets in the prediction of the amino-group-related bond angles and dihedral angles and energy barriers for adenine, guanine, and cytosine. The cc-pCVQZ and aug-cc-pVQZ MP2 results may be regarded as benchmark predictions for the five common bases. The predicted classical barriers to planarization are 0.02 (adenine), 0.74 (guanine), and 0.03 (cytosine) kcal mol-1. {\textcopyright} 2006 American Institute of Physics.

@author:   Pracht, Philipp and Bohle, Fabian and Grimme, Stefan
@doi:      10.1039/c9cp06869d
@abstract:
 We propose and discuss an efficient scheme for the in silico sampling for parts of the molecular chemical space by semiempirical tight-binding methods combined with a meta-dynamics driven search algorithm. The focus of this work is set on the generation of proper thermodynamic ensembles at a quantum chemical level for conformers, but similar procedures for protonation states, tautomerism and non-covalent complex geometries are also discussed. The conformational ensembles consisting of all significantly populated minimum energy structures normally form the basis of further, mostly DFT computational work, such as the calculation of spectra or macroscopic properties. By using basic quantum chemical methods, electronic effects or possible bond breaking/formation are accounted for and a very reasonable initial energetic ranking of the candidate structures is obtained. Due to the huge computational speedup gained by the fast low-cost quantum chemical methods, overall short computation times even for systems with hundreds of atoms (typically drug-sized molecules) are achieved. Furthermore, specialized applications, such as sampling with implicit solvation models or constrained conformational sampling for transition-states, metal-, surface-, or noncovalently bound complexes are discussed, opening many possible applications in modern computational chemistry and drug discovery. The procedures have been implemented in a freely available computer code called CREST, that makes use of the fast and reliable GFNn-xTB methods.

@abstract:
 Terminating the tip of an atomic force microscope with a CO molecule allows data to be acquired with a well-known and inert apex. Previous studies have shown conflicting results regarding the electrostatic interaction, indicating in some cases that the negative charge at the apex of the CO dominates, whereas in other cases the positive charge at the end of the metal tip dominates. To clarify this, we investigated CaF 2(111). CaF 2 is an ionic crystal and the (111) surface does not possess charge inversion symmetry. Far from the surface, the interaction is dominated by electrostatics via the negative charge at the apex. Closer to the surface, Pauli repulsion and CO bending dominate, which leads to an unexpected appearance of the complex 3-atom unit cell. We compare simulated data in which the electrostatics are modeled by point particles versus a charge density calculated by DFT. We also compare modeling Pauli repulsion via individual Lennard–Jones potentials versus a total charge density overlap. In doing so, we determine forcefield parameters useful for future investigations of biochemical processes.

@abstract:
 Following on from the success of the previous crystal structure prediction blind tests (CSP1999, CSP2001, CSP2004 and CSP2007), a fifth such collaborative project (CSP2010) was organized at the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre. A range of methodologies was used by the participating groups in order to evaluate the ability of the current computational methods to predict the crystal structures of the six organic molecules chosen as targets for this blind test. The first four targets, two rigid molecules, one semi-flexible molecule and a 1:1 salt, matched the criteria for the targets from CSP2007, while the last two targets belonged to two new challenging categories - a larger, much more flexible molecule and a hydrate with more than one polymorph. Each group submitted three predictions for each target it attempted. There was at least one successful prediction for each target, and two groups were able to successfully predict the structure of the large flexible molecule as their first place submission. The results show that while not as many groups successfully predicted the structures of the three smallest molecules as in CSP2007, there is now evidence that methodologies such as dispersion-corrected density functional theory (DFT-D) are able to reliably do so. The results also highlight the many challenges posed by more complex systems and show that there are still issues to be overcome.

 The transport of excitation energy in molecular aggregates is of crucial importance for the function of organic optoelectronic devices and next-generation solar cells. First, this review summarizes the theoretical background of the nature of the electronically excited states of molecular aggregates. For these systems, the electronic interaction between the monomers leads to the formation of exciton states. This goes along with a shift of the excitation energies and a redistribution of the oscillator strength with respect to the monomers. Next, a brief overview is provided over experimental techniques that allow to study the properties of excitons in molecular aggregates. This includes single-molecule spectroscopy, coherent two-dimensional (2D) spectroscopy, and single-molecule coherent spectroscopy. Finally, examples of molecular aggregates spanning the range from natural systems that act in photosynthesis as light-harvesting antennas to artificial aggregates built from synthetic chromophores are illustrated.

 Charge states of atoms can be investigated with scanning tunneling microscopy, but this method requires a conducting substrate. We investigated the charge-switching of individual adsorbed gold and silver atoms (adatoms) on ultrathin NaCl films on Cu(111) using a qPlus tuning fork atomic force microscope (AFM) operated at 5 kelvin with oscillation amplitudes in the subangstrom regime. Charging of a gold atom by one electron charge increases the force on the AFM tip by a few piconewtons. Moreover, the local contact potential difference is shifted depending on the sign of the charge and allows the discrimination of positively charged, neutral, and negatively charged atoms. The combination of single-electron charge sensitivity and atomic lateral resolution should foster investigations of molecular electronics, photonics, catalysis, and solar photoconversion.

@abstract:
 For centuries, the scientific discovery process has been based on systematic human observation and analysis of natural phenomena1. Today, however, automated instrumentation and large-scale data acquisition are generating datasets of such large volume and complexity as to defy conventional scientific methodology. Radically different scientific approaches are needed, and machine learning (ML) shows great promise for research fields such as materials science2–5. Given the success of ML in the analysis of synthetic data representing electronic quantum matter (EQM)6–16, the next challenge is to apply this approach to experimental data—for example, to the arrays of complex electronic-structure images17 obtained from atomic-scale visualization of EQM. Here we report the development and training of a suite of artificial neural networks (ANNs) designed to recognize different types of order hidden in such EQM image arrays. These ANNs are used to analyse an archive of experimentally derived EQM image arrays from carrier-doped copper oxide Mott insulators. In these noisy and complex data, the ANNs discover the existence of a lattice-commensurate, four-unit-cell periodic, translational-symmetry-breaking EQM state. Further, the ANNs determine that this state is unidirectional, revealing a coincident nematic EQM state. Strong-coupling theories of electronic liquid crystals18,19 are consistent with these observations.

@abstract:
 Control over interactions with biomolecules holds the key to applications of graphene in biotechnology. One such application is nanopore sequencing, where a DNA molecule is electrophoretically driven through a graphene nanopore. Here we investigate how interactions of single-stranded DNA and a graphene membrane can be controlled by electrically biasing the membrane. The results of our molecular dynamics simulations suggest that electric charge on graphene can force a DNA homopolymer to adopt a range of strikingly different conformations. The conformational response is sensitive to even very subtle nucleotide modifications, such as DNA methylation. The speed of DNA motion through a graphene nanopore is strongly affected by the graphene charge: a positive charge accelerates the motion, whereas a negative charge arrests it. As a possible application of the effect, we demonstrate stop-and-go transport of DNA controlled by the charge of graphene. Such on-demand transport of DNA is essential for realizing nanopore sequencing.

@abstract:
 Nitrogen doping of graphene significantly affects its chemical properties, which is particularly important in molecular sensing and electrocatalysis applications. However, detailed insight into interaction between N-dopant and molecules at the atomic scale is currently lacking. Here we demonstrate control over the spin state of a single iron(II) phthalocyanine molecule by its positioning on N-doped graphene. The spin transition was driven by weak intermixing between orbitals with z-component of N-dopant (pz of N-dopant) and molecule (dxz, dyz, dz2) with subsequent reordering of the Fe d-orbitals. The transition was accompanied by an electron density redistribution within the molecule, sensed by atomic force microscopy with CO-functionalized tip. This demonstrates the unique capability of the high-resolution imaging technique to discriminate between different spin states of single molecules. Moreover, we present a method for triggering spin state transitions and tuning the electronic properties of molecules through weak non-covalent interaction with suitably functionalized graphene.

@doi:      10.1021/ct3004832
@abstract:
 A quasi-continuous interpolation scheme is introduced for characterising physically realistic initial pathways from which to initiate transition state searches and construct kinetic transition networks. Applications are presented for peptides, proteins, and a morphological transformation in an atomic cluster. A simple interpolating potential is first defined, which preserves the covalent bonding framework for the biomolecules. This potential is used to identify an interpolating path by minimising contributions from a connected set of images along with terms corresponding to minima in the interatomic distances between them. This procedure, combined with repulsive terms between unconstrained atoms, helps to circumvent unphysical geometries in the line segments between images. The most difficult cases, where linear interpolation would involve chain crossings, are treated by growing the structure an atom at a time using the interpolating potential. A second optimisation phase then introduces a fraction of the true potential. Permutational alignment is achieved using a shortest augmenting path algorithm based on the local environment.

 We present a novel method, which we refer to as the dual minima hopping method, that allows us to find the global minimum of the potential energy surface (PES) within density functional theory for systems where a fast but less accurate calculation of the PES is possible. This method can rapidly find the ground state configuration of clusters and other complex systems with present day computer power by performing a systematic search. We apply the new method to silicon clusters. Even though these systems have already been extensively studied by other methods, we find new global minimum candidates for Si16 and Si19, as well as new low-lying isomers for Si16, Si17, and Si18.

@abstract:
 The funnelling of energy within multichromophoric assemblies is at the heart of the efficient conversion of solar energy by plants. The detailed mechanisms of this process are still actively debated as they rely on complex interactions between a large number of chromophores and their environment. Here we used luminescence induced by scanning tunnelling microscopy to probe model multichromophoric structures assembled on a surface. Mimicking strategies developed by photosynthetic systems, individual molecules were used as ancillary, passive or blocking elements to promote and direct resonant energy transfer between distant donor and acceptor units. As it relies on organic chromophores as the elementary components, this approach constitutes a powerful model to address fundamental physical processes at play in natural light-harvesting complexes.

@abstract:
 The Arnoldi method computes eigenvalues of large nonsymmetric matrices. Restarting is generally needed to reduce storage requirements and orthogonalization costs. However, restarting slows down the convergence and makes the choice of the new starting vector difficult if several eigenvalues are desired. We analyze several approaches to restarting and show why Sorensen's implicit QR approach is generally far superior to the others. Ritz vectors are combined in precisely the right way for an effective new starting vector. Also, a new method for restarting Arnoldi is presented. It is mathematically equivalent to the Sorensen approach but has additional uses.

@abstract:
 The high cost of platinum-based electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) has hindered the practical application of fuel cells. Thanks to its unique chemical and structural properties, nitrogen-doped graphene (NG) is among the most promising metal-free catalysts for replacing platinum. In this work, we have developed a cost-effective synthesis of NG by using cyanamide as a nitrogen source and graphene oxide as a precursor, which led to high and controllable nitrogen contents (4.0{\%} to 12.0{\%}) after pyrolysis. NG thermally treated at 900 °C shows a stable methanol crossover effect, high current density (6.67 mA cm(-2)), and durability (∼87{\%} after 10,000 cycles) when catalyzing ORR in alkaline solution. Further, iron (Fe) nanoparticles could be incorporated into NG with the aid of Fe(III) chloride in the synthetic process. This allows one to examine the influence of non-noble metals on the electrocatalytic performance. Remarkably, we found that NG supported with 5 wt {\%} Fe nanoparticles displayed an excellent methanol crossover effect and high current density (8.20 mA cm(-2)) in an alkaline solution. Moreover, Fe-incorporated NG showed almost four-electron transfer processes and superior stability in both alkaline (∼94{\%}) and acidic (∼85{\%}) solutions, which outperformed the platinum and NG-based catalysts.

@abstract:
 MOTIVATION RNA folding is a complicated kinetic process. The minimum free energy structure provides only a static view of the most stable conformational state of the system. It is insufficient to give detailed insights into the dynamic behavior of RNAs. A sufficiently sophisticated analysis of the folding free energy landscape, however, can provide the relevant information. RESULTS We introduce the basin hopping graph (BHG) as a novel coarse-grained model of folding landscapes. Each vertex of the BHG is a local minimum, which represents the corresponding basin in the landscape. Its edges connect basins when the direct transitions between them are "energetically favorable". Edge weights endcode the corresponding saddle heights and thus measure the difficulties of these favorable transitions. BHGs can be approximated accurately and efficiently for RNA molecules well beyond the length range accessible to enumerative algorithms. AVAILABILITY The algorithms described here are implemented in C++ as standalone programs. Its source code and supplemental material can be freely downloaded from http://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/bhg.html.

@abstract:
 We report the quantitative assessment of nuclear quantum effects on the strength of a single hydrogen bond formed at a water-salt interface, using tip-enhanced inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy based on a scanning tunneling microscope. The inelastic scattering cross section was resonantly enhanced by “gating” the frontier orbitals of water via a chlorine-terminated tip, so the hydrogen-bonding strength can be determined with high accuracy from the red shift in the oxygen-hydrogen stretching frequency of water. Isotopic substitution experiments combined with quantum simulations reveal that the anharmonic quantum fluctuations of hydrogen nuclei weaken the weak hydrogen bonds and strengthen the relatively strong ones. However, this trend can be completely reversed when a hydrogen bond is strongly coupled to the polar atomic sites of the surface.

@abstract:
 If the rich functionality of organic molecules is to be exploited in devices such as light-emitting diodes or field-effect transistors, interface properties of organic materials with various (metallic and insulating) substrates must be tailored carefully. In many cases, this calls for well-ordered interfaces. Organic epitaxy-that is, the growth of molecular films with a commensurate structural relationship to their crystalline substrates--relies on successful recognition of preferred epitaxial sites. For some large pi-conjugated molecules ('molecular platelets') this works surprisingly well, even if the substrate exhibits no template structure into which the molecules can lock. Here we present an explanation for site recognition in non-templated organic epitaxy, and thus resolve a long-standing puzzle. We propose that this form of site recognition relies on the existence of a local molecular reaction centre in the extended pi-electron system of the molecule. Its activity can be controlled by appropriate side groups and--in a certain regime--may also be probed by molecularly sensitized scanning tunnelling microscopy. Our results open the possibility of engineering epitaxial interfaces, as well as other interfacial nanostructures for which specific site recognition is essential.

@abstract:
 Generalized gradient approximations (GGA's) seek to improve upon the accuracy of the local-spin-density (LSD) approximation in electronic-structure calculations. Perdew and Wang have developed a GGA based on real-space cutoff of the spurious long-range components of the second-order gradient expansion for the exchange-correlation hole. We have found that this density functional performs well in numerical tests for a variety of systems: (1) Total energies of 30 atoms are highly accurate. (2) Ionization energies and electron affinities are improved in a statistical sense, although significant interconfigurational and interterm errors remain. (3) Accurate atomization energies are found for seven hydrocarbon molecules, with a rms error per bond of 0.1 eV, compared with 0.7 eV for the LSD approximation and 2.4 eV for the Hartree-Fock approximation. (4) For atoms and molecules, there is a cancellation of error between density functionals for exchange and correlation, which is most striking whenever the Hartree-Fock result is furthest from experiment. (5) The surprising LSD underestimation of the lattice constants of Li and Na by 3–4 {\%} is corrected, and the magnetic ground state of solid Fe is restored. (6) The work function, surface energy (neglecting the long-range contribution), and curvature energy of a metallic surface are all slightly reduced in comparison with LSD. Taking account of the positive long-range contribution, we find surface and curvature energies in good agreement with experimental or exact values. Finally, a way is found to visualize and understand the nonlocality of exchange and correlation, its origins, and its physical effects.

 We present a robust but still efficient simulation approach for high-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy with a flexible tip apex showing sharp submolecular features. The approach takes into account the electronic structure of sample and tip and relaxation of the tip apex. We validate our model by achieving good agreement with various experimental images which allows us to explain the origin of several observed features. Namely, we have found that high-resolution STM mechanism consists of the standard STM imaging, convolving electronic states of the sample and the tip apex orbital structure, with the contrast heavily distorted by the relaxation of the flexible apex caused by interaction with the substrate.

@abstract:
 Single molecules in a tunnel junction can now be interrogated reliably using chemically functionalized electrodes. Monitoring stochastic bonding fluctuations between a ligand bound to one electrode and its target bound to a second electrode ('tethered molecule-pair' configuration) gives insight into the nature of the intermolecular bonding at a single molecule-pair level, and defines the requirements for reproducible tunneling data. Simulations show that there is an instability in the tunnel gap at large currents, and this results in a multiplicity of contacts with a corresponding spread in the measured currents. At small currents (i.e. large gaps) the gap is stable, and functionalizing a pair of electrodes with recognition reagents (the 'free-analyte' configuration) can generate a distinct tunneling signal when an analyte molecule is trapped in the gap. This opens up a new interface between chemistry and electronics with immediate implications for rapid sequencing of single DNA molecules.

@abstract:
 We investigate the Vlasov equation as a semiclassical approximation to quantum dynamics. The effect of the self-consistent mean field is modeled by a spatially fluctuating potential given in the form of randomly distributed Gaussians. The comparison of the quantum dynamics to its semiclassical approximation is done using the emittance of a wave packet as an observable. The analysis concentrates on the h{\l}→0 limit of TDHF by considering a representative test particle problem. We check a formal estimate of the quality of the semiclassical expansion against practical results. The quality of the semiclassical approach depends much on the observable of interest {\textcopyright} 1997 Academic Press.

@abstract:
 Atomically precise graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) attract great interest because of their highly tunable electronic, optical, and transport properties. However, on-surface synthesis of GNRs is typically based on metal surface-assisted chemical reactions, where metallic substrates strongly screen their designer electronic properties and limit further applications. Here, we present an on-surface synthesis approach to forming atomically precise GNRs directly on semiconducting metal oxide surfaces. The thermally triggered multistep transformations preprogrammed in our precursors' design rely on highly selective and sequential activations of carbon-bromine (C-Br) and carbon-fluorine (C-F) bonds and cyclodehydrogenation. The formation of planar armchair GNRs terminated by well-defined zigzag ends is confirmed by scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy, which also reveal weak interaction between GNRs and the rutile titanium dioxide substrate.

 Machine learning methods are applied to finding the Green function of the Anderson impurity model, a basic model system of quantum many-body condensed matter physics. Different methods of parametrizing the Green function are investigated; a representation in terms of Legendre polynomials is found to be superior due to its limited number of coefficients and its applicability to state of the art methods of solution.

@abstract:
 This review covers a family of atomistic, mostly quantum chemistry (QC) based semiempirical methods for the fast and reasonably accurate description of large molecules in gas and condensed phase. The theory is derived from a density functional (DFT) perturbation expansion of the electron density in fluctuation terms to various orders similar to the original density functional tight binding model. The term “eXtended” in their name (xTB) emphasizes the parameter availability for almost the entire periodic table of elements (Z ≤ 86) and improvements of the underlying theory regarding, for example, the atomic orbital basis set, the level of multipole approximation and the treatment of the important electrostatic and dispersion interactions. A common feature of most members is their consistent parameterization on accurate gas phase theoretical reference data for geometries, vibrational frequencies and noncovalent interactions, which are the primary properties of interest in typical applications to systems composed of up to a few thousand atoms. Further specialized versions were developed for the description of electronic spectra and corresponding response properties. Besides a provided common theoretical background with some important implementation details in the efficient and free xtb program, various benchmarks for structural and thermochemical properties including (transition-)metal systems are discussed. The review is completed by recent extensions of the model to the force-field (FF) level as well as its application to solids under periodic boundary conditions. The general applicability together with the excellent cost-accuracy ratio and the high robustness make the xTB family of methods very attractive for various fields of computer-aided chemical research.

 Spatial resolution at the atomic scale has been achieved in the coupling of light to single molecules adsorbed on a surface. Electron transfer to a single molecule induced by green to near-infrared light in the junction of a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) exhibited spatially varying probability that is confined within the molecule. The mechanism involves photo-induced resonant tunneling in which a photoexcited electron in the STM tip is transferred to the molecule. The coupling of photons to the tunneling process provides a pathway to explore molecular dynamics with the combined capabilities of lasers and the STM.

We find the dependence of the conductance on the metal-molecule interface structure is determined by the competition between the modified metal-molecule coupling and the corresponding modified energy level lineup at the molecular junction. The results of the detailed microscopic calculation can all be understood qualitatively from the equilibrium energy level lineup and the knowledge of the voltage drop across the molecular junction at finite bias voltages.

@url:      https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0040021
@abstract:
 The recently proposed r2SCAN meta-generalized-gradient approximation (mGGA) of Furness and co-workers is used to construct an efficient composite electronic-structure method termed r2SCAN-3c. To this end, the unaltered r2SCAN functional is combined with a tailor-made triple-$\zeta$ Gaussian atomic orbital basis set as well as with refitted D4 and geometrical counter-poise corrections for London-dispersion and basis set superposition error. The performance of the new method is evaluated for the GMTKN55 database covering large parts of chemical space with about 1500 data points, as well as additional benchmarks for non-covalent interactions, organometallic reactions, and lattice energies of organic molecules and ices, as well as for the adsorption on polar salt and non-polar coinage-metal surfaces. These comprehensive tests reveal a spectacular performance and robustness of r2SCAN-3c: It by far surpasses its predecessor B97-3c at only twice the cost and provides one of the best results of all semi-local density-functional theory (DFT)/QZ methods ever tested for the GMTKN55 database at one-tenth of the cost. Specifically, for reaction and conformational energies as well as non-covalent interactions, it outperforms prominent hybrid-DFT/QZ approaches at two to three orders of magnitude lower cost. Perhaps, the most relevant remaining issue of r2SCAN-3c is self-interaction error (SIE), owing to its mGGA nature. However, SIE is slightly reduced compared to other (m)GGAs, as is demonstrated in two examples. After all, this remarkably efficient and robust method is chosen as our new group default, replacing previous composite DFT and partially even expensive high-level methods in most standard applications for systems with up to several hundreds of atoms.

@author:   Iftimie, Radu and Thomas, Jordan W. and Tuckerman, Mark E.
@doi:      10.1063/1.1636697
@abstract:
 The ab initio molecular-dynamics formalism of Car and Parrinello is extended to preserve the locality of the orbitals. The supplementary term in the Lagrangian does not affect the nuclear dynamics, but ensures "on the fly" localization of the electronic orbitals within a periodic supercell in the Gamma-point approximation. The relationship between the resulting equations of motion and the formation of a gauge-invariant Lagrangian combined with a gauge-fixing procedure is briefly discussed. The equations of motion can be used to generate a very stable and easy to implement numerical integration algorithm. It is demonstrated that this algorithm can be used to compute the trajectory of the maximally localized orbitals, known as Wannier orbitals, in ab initio molecular dynamics with only a modest increase in the overall computer time. In the present paper, the new method is implemented within the generalized gradient approximation to Kohn-Sham density-functional theory employing plane wave basis sets and atomic pseudopotentials. In the course of the presentation, we briefly discuss how the present approach can be combined with localized basis sets to design fast linear scaling ab initio molecular-dynamics methods.

@abstract:
 This paper addresses the solution of mixed-integer nonlinear mathematical programs in which the number of linear constraints far exceed the number of nonlinear constraints, and with most variables participating in the nonconvex terms. Some computer-aided molecular design models have these features. A branch-and-bound (BB) algorithm is proposed that is specifically tailored to solving such problems. In a conventional BB algorithm, branching is performed on all the search variables that appear in the nonlinear terms. This translates to a large number of node traversals. To overcome this problem, we have proposed a new strategy for branching on a set of branching functions, which depend linearly on the search variables. The branching functions are determined from a special tree function (STF) representation of both the objective function and constraints. In order to construct the corresponding linear underestimators, we have developed the Sweep method. The proposed algorithm scales well with problem size. Specifically, as the problem size increases, the computational effort increases almost linearly. The computational efficiency of the algorithm is demonstrated by solving a molecular design problem to global optimality. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

@abstract:
 Scanning tunneling microscopy images of diferrocenylacetylene (DFA) coadsorbed with benzene on Au(111) show individual and close-packed DFA molecules, either adsorbed alongside benzene or on top of a benzene monolayer. Images acquired over a range of positive and negative tip–sample bias voltages show a shift in contrast, with the acetylene linker appearing brighter than the ferrocenes at positive sample bias (where unoccupied states primarily contribute) and the reverse contrast at negative bias. Density functional theory was used to calculate the electronic structure of the gas-phase DFA molecule, and simulated images produced through two-dimensional projections of these calculations approximate the experimental images. The symmetry of both experimental and calculated molecular features for DFA rules out a cis adsorption geometry, and comparison of experiment to simulation indicates torsion around the inter-ferrocene axis between 90° and 180° (trans); the cyclopentadienyl rings are thus angled with respect to the surface.

@abstract:
 Scanning probe microscopy (SPM) has been extensively applied to probe interfacial water in many interdisciplinary fields but the disturbance of the probes on the hydrogen-bonding structure of water has remained an intractable problem. Here we report submolecular-resolution imaging of the water clusters on a NaCl(001) surface within the nearly non-invasive region by a qPlus-based noncontact atomic force microscopy. Comparison with theoretical simulations reveals that the key lies in probing the weak high-order electrostatic force between the quadrupole-like CO-terminated tip and the polar water molecules at large tip-water distances. This interaction allows the imaging and structural determination of the weakly bonded water clusters and even of their metastable states without inducing any disturbance. This work may open up new possibility of studying the intrinsic structure and electrostatics of ice or water on bulk insulating surfaces, ion hydration and biological water with atomic precision.

@abstract:
 The chemistry of mechanically interlocked molecules (MIMs), in which two or more covalently linked components are held together by mechanical bonds, has led to the coining of the term mechanostereochemistry to describe a new field of chemistry that embraces many aspects of MIMs, including their syntheses, properties, topologies where relevant and functions where operative. During the rapid development and emergence of the field, the synthesis of MIMs has witnessed the forsaking of the early and grossly inefficient statistical approaches for template-directed protocols, aided and abetted by molecular recognition processes and the tenets of self-assembly. The resounding success of these synthetic protocols, based on templation, has facilitated the design and construction of artificial molecular switches and machines, resulting more and more in the creation of integrated functional systems. This review highlights (i) the range of template-directed synthetic methods being used currently in the preparation of MIMs; (ii) the syntheses of topologically complex knots and links in the form of stable molecular compounds; and (iii) the incorporation of bistable MIMs into many different device settings associated with surfaces, nanoparticles and solid-state materials in response to the needs of particular applications that are perceived to be fair game for mechanostereochemistry.

@abstract:
 Fusion fast ignition (FI) initiated by a laser-driven particle beam promises a path to high-yield and high-gain for inertial fusion energy. FI can readily leverage the proven capability of inertial confinement fusion (ICF) drivers, such as the National Ignition Facility, to assemble DT fusion fuel at the relevant high densities. FI provides a truly alternate route to ignition, independent of the difficulties with achieving the ignition hot spot in conventional ICF. FI by laser-driven ion beams provides attractive alternatives that sidestep the present difficulties with laser-driven electron-beam FI, while leveraging the extensive recent progress in generating ion beams with high-power density on existing laser facilities. Whichever the ion species, the ignition requirements are similar: delivering a power density ≈1022 W cm−3 (∼10 kJ in ≈20 ps within a volume of linear dimension ≈20 µm), to the DT fuel compressed to ∼400 g cm−3 with areal density ∼2 g cm−2. High-current, laser-driven beams of many ion species are promising candidates to deliver such high-power densities. The reason is that high energy, high-power laser drivers can deliver high-power fluxes that can efficiently make ion beams that are born neutralized in ∼fs–ps timescales, making them immune to the charge and current limits of conventional beams. In summary, we find that there are many possible paths to success with FI based on laser-driven ion beams. Although many ion species could be used for ignition, we concentrate here on either protons or C ions, which are technologically convenient species. We review the work to date on FI design studies with those species. We also review the tremendous recent progress in discovering, characterizing and developing many ion-acceleration mechanisms relevant to FI. We also summarize key recent technological advances and methods underwriting that progress. Based on the design studies and on the increased understanding of the physics of laser-driven ion acceleration, we provide laser and ion-generation laser-target design points based on several distinct ion-acceleration mechanisms.

@abstract:
 Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.

@title:    Neural Programmer-Interpreters
@keywords: Folder - Computers - QuantumComputing
@author:   Reed, Scott and de Freitas, Nando
@url:      http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06279
@abstract:
 We propose the neural programmer-interpreter (NPI): a recurrent and compositional neural network that learns to represent and execute programs. NPI has three learnable components: a task-agnostic recurrent core, a persistent key-value program memory, and domain-specific encoders that enable a single NPI to operate in multiple perceptually diverse environments with distinct affordances. By learning to compose lower-level programs to express higher-level programs, NPI reduces sample complexity and increases generalization ability compared to sequence-to-sequence LSTMs. The program memory allows efficient learning of additional tasks by building on existing programs. NPI can also harness the environment (e.g. a scratch pad with read-write pointers) to cache intermediate results of computation, lessening the long-term memory burden on recurrent hidden units. In this work we train the NPI with fully-supervised execution traces; each program has example sequences of calls to the immediate subprograms conditioned on the input. Rather than training on a huge number of relatively weak labels, NPI learns from a small number of rich examples. We demonstrate the capability of our model to learn several types of compositional programs: addition, sorting, and canonicalizing 3D models. Furthermore, a single NPI learns to execute these programs and all 21 associated subprograms.

@abstract:
 We describe the first principle‐based electron force field (eFF) methodology for modeling the simultaneous dynamics of electrons and nuclei (eMD) evolving nonadiabatically under transient extreme conditions. We introduce the parallel implementation of eFF (pEFF) that makes it practical to perform simulations of the nonadiabatic dynamics of materials in extreme environments involving millions of nuclei and electrons, over multi‐picoseconds time scales, and demonstrate its application to: (i) accurately determine density and predict percent ionization of hydrogen at high pressure (∼61 GPa) and temperatures up to 15,300 K and (ii) determine, the single shock Hugoniot for lithium metal directly from the shock wave kinematics, i.e., mass velocities ( U p ) and shock wave velocities ( U s ), and shock density data. For (i), the density and ionization fractions of hydrogen atoms were calculated using the isobaric–isothermal ensemble at an isotropic pressure of 61.4 GPa and for temperatures between 300 K and 15,300 K. The results at 15,300 K describe a molecular fluid with density $\rho$ = 0.36 g/cm 3 , in close agreement with existing experiments and theory, and ∼0.5{\%} ionization. This result provides no indication of the existence of a critical plasma phase‐transition point at this particular temperature and pressure, as previously predicted by others. For (ii), the relationship between U p and U s was characterized to be linear and plastic in the range 1–20 km/s, and the single shock Hugoniot was determined in close agreement with published results for experimentally reported U p s. In addition to this, we provide a description of the materials' behavior for large U p s in terms of the appearance of a weak metallic plasma phase by U p = 10 km/s, with ≃ 8{\%} ionization, gradually transitioning to a denser plasma with an estimated ≃ 35{\%} ionization by U p = 15 km/s. Last but not least, we confirm the computational efficiency and scalability of pEFF by comparing its single processor performance against the fastest existing serial code, which results in a linear speedup ∼10× faster for every 16,000 particles in favor of pEFF, and by evaluating its parallel performance in terms of its strong and weak scaling capabilities. Our results, on Los Alamos's Lobo supercomputer (a 38TFLOPSs Linux HPC with Quad‐core AMD Opteron nodes interconnected with an Infiniband), show strong scaling with near ideal speedups for loads {\textgreater}62 particles per processor. Weak scaling is shown to be close to linear under the same per‐processor load range. As an absolute reference, an NVT run with 2 million particle lithium bulk system (0.5 M nuclei and 1.5 M electrons) on Lobo takes ∼0.44 s/timestep on 1024 processors (∼1 day/ps using an integration timestep of 0.005 fs). {\textcopyright} 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

@abstract:
 Free-standing silicene, a silicon analogue of graphene, has a buckled honeycomb lattice and, because of its Dirac bandstructure combined with its sensitive surface, offers the potential for a widely tunable two-dimensional monolayer, where external fields and interface interactions can be exploited to influence fundamental properties such as bandgap and band character for future nanoelectronic devices. The quantum spin Hall effect, chiral superconductivity, giant magnetoresistance and various exotic field-dependent states have been predicted in monolayer silicene. Despite recent progress regarding the epitaxial synthesis of silicene and investigation of its electronic properties, to date there has been no report of experimental silicene devices because of its air stability issue. Here, we report a silicene field-effect transistor, corroborating theoretical expectations regarding its ambipolar Dirac charge transport, with a measured room-temperature mobility of ∼100 cm(2) V(-1) s(-1) attributed to acoustic phonon-limited transport and grain boundary scattering. These results are enabled by a growth-transfer-fabrication process that we have devised-silicene encapsulated delamination with native electrodes. This approach addresses a major challenge for material preservation of silicene during transfer and device fabrication and is applicable to other air-sensitive two-dimensional materials such as germanene and phosphorene. Silicene's allotropic affinity with bulk silicon and its low-temperature synthesis compared with graphene or alternative two-dimensional semiconductors suggest a more direct integration with ubiquitous semiconductor technology.

@abstract:
 Oxygen (O2) adsorbed on metal oxides is important in catalytic oxidation reactions, chemical sensing, and photocatalysis. Strong adsorption requires transfer of negative charge from oxygen vacancies (V(O)s) or dopants, for example. With scanning tunneling microscopy, we observed, transformed, and, in conjunction with theory, identified the nature of O2 molecules on the (101) surface of anatase (titanium oxide, TiO2) doped with niobium. V(O)s reside exclusively in the bulk, but we pull them to the surface with a strongly negatively charged scanning tunneling microscope tip. O2 adsorbed as superoxo (O2(-)) at fivefold-coordinated Ti sites was transformed to peroxo (O2(2-)) and, via reaction with a VO, placed into an anion surface lattice site as an (O2)O species. This so-called bridging dimer also formed when O2 directly reacted with V(O)s at or below the surface.

@abstract:
 A new method is presented for the construction of ab initio quality approximate electronic charge distributions for large molecules from charge distributions of small molecular fragments. This method is reminiscent to building structures using Lego blocks. The electronic density distribution calculated using the method is quantitatively shown to be very similar to that calculated for entire molecules using conventional ab initio packages with standard basis sets such as 6-31G**, while requiring only a fraction of the computational time. The pre-calculated fuzzy electron distributions of base molecular fragments, stored in a data bank, are merged (rotated, translated, and subsequently added together) to calculate these approximate charge distributions for the molecule. The method requires only the Cartesian coordinates of the nuclei for the construction of molecular charge distributions. The speed of the method makes it potentially useful for molecular modeling applications where construction of electron densities of large molecules is especially important. The technique can be used to replace fused sphere models of large molecules with more realistic electron density contours. One additional advantage is that these contours can be displayed for a whole range of density values, from tight, high-density contours, representing the bonding pattern, to loose, low-density contours representing the peripheral shape and size features of molecules. {\textcopyright} 1993, American Chemical Society.

@abstract:
 The internal vibrations of molecules drive the structural transformations that underpin chemistry and cellular function. While vibrational frequencies are measured by spectroscopy, the normal modes of motion are inferred through theory because their visualization would require microscopy with {\aa}ngstr{\"{o}}m-scale spatial resolution—nearly three orders of magnitude smaller than the diffraction limit in optics1. Using a metallic tip to focus light and taking advantage of the surface-enhanced Raman effect2 to amplify the signal from individual molecules, tip-enhanced Raman spectromicroscopy (TER-SM)3,4 reaches the requisite sub-molecular spatial resolution5, confirming that light can be confined in picocavities6–10 and anticipating the direct visualization of molecular vibrations11–13. Here, by using TER-SM at the precisely controllable junction of a cryogenic ultrahigh-vacuum scanning tunnelling microscope14–16, we show that {\aa}ngstr{\"{o}}m-scale resolution is attained at subatomic separation between the tip atom and a molecule in the quantum tunnelling regime of plasmons6,8,9,17. We record vibrational spectra within a single molecule, obtain images of normal modes and atomically parse the intramolecular charges and currents driven by vibrations. Our analysis provides a paradigm for optics in the atomistic near-field.

@abstract:
 In this paper the first-principles generalized pseudopotential theory (GPT) of transition-metal interatomic potentials [J. A. Moriarty, Phys. Rev. B 38, 3199 (1988)] is extended to AB binary compounds and alloys. For general transition-metal (TM) systems, the GPT total-energy functional involves a volume term, central-force pair potentials, and angular-force multi-ion potentials, which are both volume (?) and concentration (x) dependent and include all sp, sp-d, and d-d interactions within local density-functional quantum mechanics. The formalism is developed here in detail for intermetallic systems where A is a simple metal and B is a transition metal and applied to the prominent special case of the transition-metal aluminides TMxAl1-x, where sp-d hybridization is especially important. Emphasis is given to the aluminum-rich 3d binary systems for x{\textless}0.30, which appear to be well described at the pair-potential level without angular forces and for which the present GPT potentials can be used directly in atomistic simulations. Volume terms and pair potentials for all of the 3d aluminides have been calculated and their behavior with atomic number, ?, and x is elaborated through illustrative applications to the cohesive and structural trends across the 3d series. More extensive applications to the Co-Al and Ni-Al phase diagrams will be given elsewhere.

@abstract:
 Most methods of crystal structure prediction generate many trial structures. Because these may differ in choice of unit cell, it is not always immediately obvious whether or not two such structures are equivalent. A method to answer this question is described for the case where the asymmetric unit contains one molecule in a general position, defined by the rotation and translation of that molecule with respect to some reference geometry. In the comparison of two structures, the rotation needed to transform one orientation into the other is determined first. Then it is checked whether this rotation corresponds to a transformation that is compatible with the imposed space group symmetry. A final test compares the cell lengths, the cell angles, and the molecular centers of gravity after the transformation of one structure into the other. The method is implemented for triclinic, monoclinic, and orthorhombic systems and is found to be very fast in tests on hypothetical crystal structures of acetic acid.

@abstract:
 A key challenge in the field of nanotechnology, in particular in the design of molecular machines, novel materials or molecular electronics, is the bottom-up construction of covalently bound molecular architectures in a well-defined arrangement. To date, only rather simple structures have been obtained because of the limitation of one-step connection processes. Indeed, for the formation of sophisticated structures, step-by-step connection of molecules is required. Here, we present a strategy for the covalent connection of molecules in a hierarchical manner by the selective and sequential activation of specific sites, thereby generating species with a programmed reactivity. This approach leads to improved network quality and enables the fabrication of heterogeneous architectures with high selectivity. Furthermore, substrate-directed growth and a preferred orientation of the molecular nanostructures are achieved on an anisotropic surface. The demonstrated control over reactivity and diffusion during covalent bond formation constitutes a promising route towards the creation of sophisticated multi-component molecular nanostructures.

@url:      http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28569317
@abstract:
 The origin of non-additivity in hydrogen bonds (H-bonds), usually termed as H-bond cooperativity, is investigated in H-bonded linear chains. It is shown that H-bond cooperativity originates solely from classical electrostatics. The latter is corroborated by comparing the H-bond cooperativity in infinitely-long H-bonded hydrogen cyanide, 4-pyridone and formamide chains, assessed using density functional theory (DFT), against the strengthening of the dipole-dipole interaction upon the formation of an infinite chain of effective point-dipoles. It is found that the magnitude of these effective point-dipoles is a consequence of mutual polarization and additional effects beyond a polarizable point-dipole model. Nevertheless, the effective point-dipoles are fully determined once a single H-bond is formed, indicating that quantum effects involved in H-bonding are circumscribed to nearest-neighbor interactions only; i.e. in a linear chain of H-bonds, quantum effects do not contribute to the H-bond non-additivity. This finding is verified by estimating cooperativity along the dissociation path of H-bonds in the infinite chains, using two empirical parameters that account for polarizability, together with DFT association energies and molecular dipoles of solely monomers and dimers.

 A structure prediction method is presented based on the minima hopping method. To escape local minima, moves on the configurational enthalpy surface are performed by variable cell shape molecular dynamics. To optimize the escape steps the initial atomic and cell velocities are aligned to low curvature directions of the current local minimum. The method is applied to both silicon crystals and well-studied binary Lennard-Jones mixtures. For the latter new putative ground state structures are presented. It is shown that a high success rate is achieved and a reliable prediction of unknown ground state structures is possible.

@abstract:
 A comprehensive review is presented of single-molecule junction conductance measurements across families of molecules measured while breaking a gold point contact in a solution of molecules with amine end groups. A theoretical framework unifies the picture for the amine-gold link bonding and the tunnel coupling through the junction using density functional theory based calculations. The reproducible electrical characteristics and utility for many molecules is shown to result from the selective binding between the gold electrodes and amine link groups through a donor-acceptor bond to undercoordinated gold atoms. While the bond energy is modest, the maximum force sustained by the junction is comparable to, but less than, that required to break gold point contacts. The calculated tunnel coupling provides conductance trends for all 41 molecule measurements presented here, as well as insight into the variability of conductance due to the conformational changes within molecules with torsional degrees of freedom. The calculated trends agree to within a factor of 2 with the measured values for conductance ranging from 10(-7)G(0) to 10(-2)G(0), where G(0) is the quantum of conductance (2e(2)/h).

@abstract:
 F1F0 ATP synthase (ATPase) either facilitates the synthesis of ATP in the mitochondrial membranes and bacterial inner membranes in a process driven by the proton moving force (pmf), or uses the energy from ATP hydrolysis to pump protons against the concentration gradient across the membrane. ATPase is composed of two rotary motors, F0 and F1, which generate the opposing rotation and compete for control of their shared central gamma-shaft. Here we present a self-consistent physical model of the F1 motor as a simplified two-state Brownian ratchet based on the asymmetry of torsional elastic energy of the coiled-coil gamma-shaft. This stochastic model unifies the physical description of linear and rotary motors and explains the stepped unidirectional rotation of the {\$}\backslashgamma{\$}-shaft, in agreement with the `binding-change' ideas of Boyer. Substituting the model parameters, all independently known from recent experiments, our model quantitatively reproduces the ATPase operation, e.g. the `no-load' angular velocity is ca. 400{\~{}}rad/s anticlockwise at 4 mM ATP, in close agreement with experiment. Increasing the pmf torque exerted by F0 can slow, stop and overcome the torque generated by F1, switching from ATP hydrolysis to synthesis at a very low value of `stall torque'. We discuss the matters of the motor efficiency, which is very low if calculated from the useful mechanical work it produces - but is quite high when the `useful outcome' is measured in the number of H+ pushed against the chemical gradient in the F1 ATP-driven operation.

@abstract:
 Rational design of compounds with specific properties requires understanding and fast evaluation of molecular properties throughout chemical compound space — the huge set of all potentially stable molecules. Recent advances in combining quantum-mechanical calculations with machine learning provide powerful tools for exploring wide swathes of chemical compound space. We present our perspective on this exciting and quickly developing field by discussing key advances in the development and applications of quantum-mechanics-based machine-learning methods to diverse compounds and properties, and outlining the challenges ahead. We argue that significant progress in the exploration and understanding of chemical compound space can be made through a systematic combination of rigorous physical theories, comprehensive synthetic data sets of microscopic and macroscopic properties, and modern machine-learning methods that account for physical and chemical knowledge.

@abstract:
 As the size of a molecular emitter becomes comparable to the dimensions of a nearby optical resonator, the standard approach that considers the emitter to be a point-like dipole breaks down. By adoption of a quantum description of the electronic transitions of organic molecular emitters, coupled to a plasmonic electromagnetic field, we are able to accurately calculate the position-dependent coupling strength between a plasmon and an emitter. The spatial distribution of excitonic and photonic quantum states is found to be a key aspect in determining the dynamics of molecular emission in ultrasmall cavities both in the weak and strong coupling regimes. Moreover, we show that the extreme localization of plasmonic fields leads to the selection rule breaking of molecular excitations.

@abstract:
 An algorithm is presented for the rapid evaluation of the potential and force fields in systems involving large numbers of particles whose interactions are Coulombic or gravitational in nature. For a system of N particles, an amount of work of the order O(N2) has traditionally been required to evaluate all pairwise interactions, unless some approximation or truncation method is used. The algorithm of the present paper requires an amount of work proportional to N to evaluate all interactions to within roundoff error, making it considerably more practical for large-scale problems encountered in plasma physics, fluid dynamics, molecular dynamics, and celestial mechanics.

@abstract:
 In order to determine the role of subregions of the hippocampus in spatial working memory, this study combined selective neurotoxic lesions of the hippocampal subregions with a simple delayed nonmatching-to-place task on a radial maze in rats. Lesions of the dentate gyrus or the CA3, but not the CA1, subregion of the hippocampus induced a deficit in the acquisition of the task with short-term delays (i.e., 10 sec) and impaired performance of the task in a novel environment. All subregional lesions produced sustained impairment in performing the task with intermediate-term delays (i.e., 5 min) when rats were tested in a familiar environment. The results suggest a dynamic interaction among the dorsal hippocampal subregions in processing spatial working memory, with the time window (i.e., delay) of a task recognized as an essential controlling factor.

@abstract:
 Ferrocene-based molecules are extremely appealing as they offer a prospect of having built-in spin or charge functionality. However, there are only limited number of studies of structural and electronic properties on surfaces so far. We investigated the self-assembly processes of 1,1′-ferrocene dicarboxylic acid molecules (C12H10FeO4) on both metallic (Ag(111), Au(111), and Cu(110)) and insulating (Cu3N/Cu(110)) surfaces with high-resolution ncAFM/STM, XPS, and NEXAFS. The experimental evidence is corroborated with total energy DFT calculations and ncAFM simulations. The combined experimental and theoretical analysis allows detailed understanding of the unique arrangement and adsorption geometries of the molecules on different substrates, as well as the different chemical stability of the carboxylic (COOH) groups. The molecules on noble (Ag, Au) surfaces show only a weak interaction with the substrate forming a complex self-assembled pattern, driven by weak intermolecular interactions. In contrast, the analysis reveals the carboxylic groups undergo dehydrogenation on the Cu(110) and Cu3N/Cu(110). As a result, the oxygen atoms form strong chemical bonds to the substrate Cu atoms and impose an orientation on the ferrocene cyclopentadienyl rings perpendicular to the substrate.

@abstract:
 In contrast to the wide number and variety of available synthetic routes to conventional linear polymers, the synthesis of two-dimensional polymers and unambiguous proof of their structure remains a challenge. Two-dimensional polymers—single-layered polymers that form a tiling network in exactly two dimensions—have potential for use in nanoporous membranes and other applications. Here, we report the preparation of a fluorinated hydrocarbon two-dimensional polymer that can be exfoliated into single sheets, and its characterization by high-resolution single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. The procedure involves three steps: preorganization in a lamellar crystal of a rigid monomer bearing three photoreactive arms, photopolymerization of the crystalline monomers by [4 + 4] cycloaddition, and isolation of individual two-dimensional polymer sheets. This polymer is a molecularly thin ({\~{}}1 nm) material that combines precisely defined monodisperse pores of {\~{}}9 {\AA} with a high pore density of 3.3 × 1013 pores cm−2. Atomic-resolution single-crystal X-ray structures of the monomer, an intermediate dimer and the final crystalline two-dimensional polymer were obtained and prove the single-crystal-to-single-crystal nature and molecular precision of the two-dimensional photopolymerization.

@abstract:
 Semiempirical molecular orbital (SEMO) models based on the neglect of diatomic differential overlap (NDDO) approximation efficiently solve the self-consistent field equations by rather drastic approximations. The computational efficiency comes at the cost of an error in the electron-electron repulsion integrals. The error may be compensated by the introduction of parametric expressions to evaluate the electron-electron repulsion integrals, the one-electron integrals, and the core-core repulsion. We review the resulting formalisms of popular NDDO-SEMO models (such as the MNDO(/d), AM1, PMx, and OMx models) in a concise and self-contained manner. We discuss the approaches to implicitly and explicitly describe electron correlation effects within NDDO-SEMO models and we dissect strengths and weaknesses of the different approaches in a detailed analysis. For this purpose, we consider the results of recent benchmark studies. Furthermore, we apply bootstrapping to perform a sensitivity analysis for a selection of parameters in the MNDO model. We also identify systematic limitations of NDDO-SEMO models by drawing on an analogy to Kohn-Sham density functional theory.

@abstract:
 We perform a detailed theoretical study of the characteristic internal electronic structure of various multiexcitons (Nh,Ne), where Nh is number of holes and Ne is the number of electrons in the self-assembled semiconductor quantum dots (QDs). For each of the leading (Nh,Ne) excitonic complexes we start from the single-particle configuration (e.g., a specific occupation pattern of S and P electron and hole levels by a few carriers) and then show the many-particle multiplet levels for the initial state of emission (Nh,Ne) and the final state of emission (Nh{\&}minus;1,  Ne{\&}minus;1). We denote which states are dark and which are bright; the order and multiplicity, the leading single-particle character of each multiplet state, and the fine-structure splittings. These are of general utility. We also show explicit numerical values for distances between various transitions for four specific QDs. Here the presented information is important and potentially useful for a few reasons: (i) the information serves as a guide for spectroscopic interpretation; (ii) the information reveals non-Aufbau cases, where the dot does not have Aufbau occupation of carriers' levels; (iii) the information shows which transitions are sensitive to random-alloy fluctuations (if the dot is alloyed) and importance of this effect. We show that because of such alloy information, distances between peaks cannot be used to gauge structural information.

 Tunneling electrons from a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) were used to excite photon emission from individual porphyrin molecules adsorbed on an ultrathin alumina film grown on a NiAl(110) surface. Vibrational features were observed in the light-emission spectra that depended sensitively on the different molecular conformations and corresponding electronic states obtained by scanning tunneling spectroscopy. The high spatial resolution of the STM enabled the demonstration of variations in light-emission spectra from different parts of the molecule. These experiments realize the feasibility of fluorescence spectroscopy with the STM and enable the integration of optical spectroscopy with a nanoprobe for the investigation of single molecules.

@abstract:
 Spectral sensitization of a mesoporous graphite carbon nitride (mpg-C(3)N(4)) photocatalyst was investigated by depositing magnesium phthalocyanine (MgPc) to expand the absorption to wavelengths longer than those of the principal mpg-C(3)N(4). The obtained sample, MgPc/Pt/mpg-C(3)N(4) (Pt as a cocatalyst) showed stable photocatalytic evolution of hydrogen from aqueous solution in the presence of sacrificial reagents (triethanolamine), even under irradiation at wavelengths longer than 600 nm. Increasing the amount of MgPc led to ordered MgPc aggregation on the photocatalyst surfaces. The rate of photocatalytic hydrogen evolution was highest on a sample with an amount of MgPc corresponding to a monolayer on the Pt/mpg-C(3)N(4) photocatalyst surface. The obtained action spectra of hydrogen evolution and the observation that the amount of evolved hydrogen substantially surpassed the amount of MgPc, confirm that the introduced MgPc functioned as a photocatalytic sensitizer.

@abstract:
 In this paper, we discuss the validity of the band structure concept in silicon nanocrystals a few nanometers in size. We introduce a general method which allows reconstruction of a fuzzy electronic band structure of nanocrystals from ordinary real-space electronic structure calculations. A comprehensive study of the fuzzy band structure of a realistic nanocrystal is given including full geometric and electronic relaxation with the surface passivating groups. In particular, we combine this method with large-scale density functional theory calculations to obtain insight into the luminescence properties of silicon nanocrystals up to 3 nm in size depending on the surface passivation and geometric distortion. We conclude that the band-structure concept is applicable to silicon nanocrystals with a diameter larger than ≈2 nm with certain limitations. We also show how perturbations due to polarized surface groups or geometric distortion can lead to considerable moderation of momentum space selection rules. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Physical Society.

 We consider quantum computations comprising only commuting gates, known as IQP computations, and provide compelling evidence that the task of sampling their output probability distributions is unlikely to be achievable by any efficient classical means. More specifically, we introduce the class post-IQP of languages decided with bounded error by uniform families of IQP circuits with post-selection, and prove first that post-IQP equals the classical class PP. Using this result we show that if the output distributions of uniform IQP circuit families could be classically efficiently sampled, either exactly in total variation distance or even approximately up to 41 per cent multiplicative error in the probabilities, then the infinite tower of classical complexity classes known as the polynomial hierarchy would collapse to its third level. We mention some further results on the classical simulation properties of IQP circuit families, in particular showing that if the output distribution results from measurements on only [IMG]/medium/RSPA20100301IM1.gif" ALT="Formula "{\textgreater} lines then it may, in fact, be classically efficiently sampled.

@abstract:
 The promise of quantum computers is that certain computational tasks might be executed exponentially faster on a quantum processor than on a classical processor1. A fundamental challenge is to build a high-fidelity processor capable of running quantum algorithms in an exponentially large computational space. Here we report the use of a processor with programmable superconducting qubits2–7 to create quantum states on 53 qubits, corresponding to a computational state-space of dimension 253 (about 1016). Measurements from repeated experiments sample the resulting probability distribution, which we verify using classical simulations. Our Sycamore processor takes about 200 seconds to sample one instance of a quantum circuit a million times—our benchmarks currently indicate that the equivalent task for a state-of-the-art classical supercomputer would take approximately 10,000 years. This dramatic increase in speed compared to all known classical algorithms is an experimental realization of quantum supremacy8–14 for this specific computational task, heralding a much-anticipated computing paradigm.

@abstract:
 Determination of the exact structure of individual molecules is the ultimate goal of high-resolution microscopy. However, the resolution of scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) is intrinsically limited to the extent of molecular orbitals, which frequently do not differ for small changes in the molecular conformation. Here we use the position of water molecules during the first hydration steps of an azobenzene derivative on Au(111) to determine not only the orientation of the end groups with respect to the phenyl rings but also the orientation of the two phenyl rings with respect to the azo group. We investigate the co-adsorption of 4,4'-hydroxy-azobenzene and water molecules on Au(111) by low-temperature STM. The water molecules are attached exclusively to the hydroxyl end groups of the azobenzene derivatives. Predominantly the trans-azobenzene molecule with the two hydroxyl groups pointing into opposite directions is adsorbed. As corroborated by the attachment of a single water molecule to 4-anilino-4'-nitro azobenzene on the same inert surface, the method is generally applicable for structure determination of molecules with appropriate end groups. Our study thus gives unprecedented information about the intramolecular orientation based on the first real space observation of the hydration of a functional molecule.

 Low-speed aerodynamics is important in the design and operation of aircraft flying at low Mach number, and ground and marine vehicles. This text offers a modern treatment of both the theory of inviscid, incompressible, and irrotational aerodynamics, and the computational techniques now available to solve complex problems. A unique feature is that the computational approach--from a single vortex element to a three-dimensional panel formulation--is interwoven throughout. This second edition features a new chapter on the laminar boundary layer (emphasis on the viscous-inviscid coupling), the latest versions of computational techniques, and additional coverage of interaction problems.

@abstract:
 Manipulation is the most exciting feature of the non-contact atomic force microscopy technique as it allows building nanostructures on surfaces. Usually vertical manipulations are accompanied by an abrupt tip modification leading to a change of contrast. Here we report on low-temperature experiments demonstrating vertical manipulations of 'super'-Cu atoms on the p(2 × 1) Cu(110):O surface, both extractions to and depositions from the tip, when the imaging contrast remains the same. These results are rationalized employing a novel and completely general method that combines density functional theory calculations for obtaining energy barriers as a function of tip height and a Kinetic Monte Carlo algorithm for studying the tip dynamics and extraction of manipulation statistics. The model reveals a novel multi-step manipulation mechanism combining activated jumps of 'super'-Cu atoms to/from the tip with their drag by and diffusion on the tip.

@abstract:
 This paper argues that the requirement of applicableness of quantum linearity to any physical level from molecules and atoms to the level of macroscopic extensional world, which leads to a main foundational problem in quantum theory referred to as the "measurement problem", actually has a computational character: It implies that there is a generic algorithm, which guarantees exact solutions to the Schrodinger equation for every physical system in a reasonable amount of time regardless of how many constituent microscopic particles it comprises. From the point of view of computational complexity theory, this requirement is equivalent to the assumption that the computational complexity classes P and NP are equal, which is widely believed to be very unlikely. As demonstrated in the paper, accepting the different computational assumption called the Exponential Time Hypothesis (that involves P!=NP) would justify the separation between a microscopic quantum system and a macroscopic apparatus (usually called the Heisenberg cut) since this hypothesis, if true, would imply that deterministic quantum and classical descriptions are impossible to overlap in order to obtain a rigorous derivation of complete properties of macroscopic objects from their microstates.

@abstract:
 Theoretical ideas are proposed for laser control of chemical dynamics. There are the following three elementary processes in chemical dynamics: (i) motion of the wave packet on a single adiabatic potential energy surface, (ii) excitation/de-excitation or pump/dump of wave packet, and (iii) nonadiabatic transitions at conical intersections of potential energy surfaces. A variety of chemical dynamics can be controlled, if we can control these three elementary processes as we desire. For (i) we have formulated the semiclassical guided optimal control theory, which can be applied to multidimensional real systems. The quadratic or periodic frequency chirping method can achieve process (ii) with high efficiency close to 100{\%}. Concerning process (iii) mentioned above, the directed momentum method, in which a predetermined momentum vector is given to the initial wave packet, makes it possible to enhance the desired transitions at conical intersections. In addition to these three processes, the intriguing phenomenon of complete reflection in the nonadiabatic-tunneling-type of potential curve crossing can also be used to control a certain class of chemical dynamics. The basic ideas and theoretical formulations are provided for the above-mentioned processes. To demonstrate the effectiveness of these controlling methods, numerical examples are shown by taking the following processes: (a) vibrational photoisomerization of HCN, (b) selective and complete excitation of the fine structure levels of K and Cs atoms, (c) photoconversion of cyclohexadiene to hexatriene, and (d) photodissociation of OHCl to O + HCl.

@abstract:
 Statistical mechanics is founded on the assumption that all accessible configurations of a system are equally likely. This requires dynamics that explore all states over time, known as ergodic dynamics. In isolated quantum systems, however, the occurrence of ergodic behavior has remained an outstanding question. Here, we demonstrate ergodic dynamics in a small quantum system consisting of only three superconducting qubits. The qubits undergo a sequence of rotations and interactions and we measure the evolution of the density matrix. Maps of the entanglement entropy show that the full system can act like a reservoir for individual qubits, increasing their entropy through entanglement. Surprisingly, these maps bear a strong resemblance to the phase space dynamics in the classical limit; classically chaotic motion coincides with higher entanglement entropy. We further show that in regions of high entropy the full multi-qubit system undergoes ergodic dynamics. Our work illustrates how controllable quantum systems can investigate fundamental questions in non-equilibrium thermodynamics.

@abstract:
 Surfaces are at the frontier of every known solid. They provide versatile supports for functional nanostructures and mediate essential physicochemical processes. Being intimately related with 2D materials, interfaces and atomically thin films often feature distinct electronic states with respect to the bulk, which are key for many relevant properties, such as catalytic activity, interfacial charge-transfer, or crystal growth mechanisms. Of particular interest is reducing the surface electrons' dimensionality and spread with atomic precision, to induce novel quantum properties via lateral scattering and confinement. Both atomic manipulation and supramolecular principles provide access to custom-designed molecular superlattices, which tailor the surface electronic landscape and influence fundamental chemical and physical properties at the nanoscale. Herein, we review the confinement of surface state electrons focusing on their interaction with molecule-based scaffolds created by molecular manipulation and self-assembly protocols under ultrahigh vacuum conditions. Starting from the quasi-free 2D electron gas present at the (111)-terminated surface planes of noble metals, we illustrate the enhanced molecule-based structural complexity and versatility compared to simple atoms. We survey low-dimensional confining structures in the form of artificial lattices, molecular nanogratings or quantum dot arrays, which are constructed upon appropriate choice of their building constituents. Whenever the realized (metal-)organic networks exhibit long-range order, modified surface band structures with characteristic features emerge, revealing intriguing physical properties, such as discretization, quantum coupling or energy and effective mass renormalization. Such collective electronic states can be additionally modified by positioning guest species at the voids of open nanoarchitectures [...].

@abstract:
 Currently, organic crystal structure prediction (CSP) methods are based on searching for the most thermodynamically stable crystal structure, making various approximations in evaluating the crystal energy. The most stable (global minimum) structure provides a prediction of an experimental crystal structure. However, depending on the specific molecule, there may be other structures which are very close in energy. In this case, the other structures on the crystal energy landscape may be polymorphs, components of static or dynamic disorder in observed structures, or there may be no route to nucleating and growing these structures. A major reason for performing CSP studies is as a complement to solid form screening to see which alternative packings to the known polymorphs are thermodynamically feasible.

@abstract:
 Universal quantum computers promise a dramatic speed-up over classical computers but a full-size realization remains challenging. However, intermediate quantum computational models have been proposed that are not universal, but can solve problems that are strongly believed to be classically hard. Aaronson and Arkhipov have shown that interference of single photons in random optical networks can solve the hard problem of sampling the bosonic output distribution which is directly connected to computing matrix permanents. Remarkably, this computation does not require measurement-based interactions or adaptive feed-forward techniques. Here we demonstrate this model of computation using high--quality laser--written integrated quantum networks that were designed to implement random unitary matrix transformations. We experimentally characterize the integrated devices using an in--situ reconstruction method and observe three-photon interference that leads to the boson-sampling output distribution. Our results set a benchmark for quantum computers, that hold the potential of outperforming conventional ones using only a few dozen photons and linear-optical elements.

@abstract:
 A new open-source high-performance implementation of Born Oppenheimer molecular dynamics based on semiempirical quantum mechanics models using PyTorch called PYSEQM is presented. PYSEQM was designed to provide researchers in computational chemistry with an open-source, efficient, scalable, and stable quantum-based molecular dynamics engine. In particular, PYSEQM enables computation on modern graphics processing unit hardware and, through the use of automatic differentiation, supplies interfaces for model parameterization with machine learning techniques to perform multiobjective training and prediction. The implemented semiempirical quantum mechanical methods (MNDO, AM1, and PM3) are described. Additional algorithms include a recursive Fermi-operator expansion scheme (SP2) and extended Lagrangian Born Oppenheimer molecular dynamics allowing for rapid simulations. Finally, benchmark testing on the nanostar dendrimer and a series of polyethylene molecules provides a baseline of code efficiency, time cost, and scaling and stability of energy conservation, verifying that PYSEQM provides fast and accurate computations.

 We present a transmission electron microscopy investigation of graphene membranes, crystalline foils with a thickness of only 1 atom. By using aberration-correction in combination with a monochromator, 1-A resolution is achieved at an acceleration voltage of only 80 kV. The low voltage is crucial for the stability of these membranes. As a result, every individual carbon atom in the field of view is detected and resolved. We observe a highly crystalline lattice along with occasional point defects. The formation and annealing of Stone-Wales defects is observed in situ. Multiple five- and seven-membered rings appear exclusively in combinations that avoid dislocations and disclinations, in contrast to previous observations on highly curved (tube- or fullerene-like) graphene surfaces.

 The strong spatial confinement of a nanocavity plasmonic field has made it possible to visualize the inner structure of a single molecule and even to distinguish its vibrational modes in real space. With such ever-improved spatial resolution, it is anticipated that full vibrational imaging of a molecule could be achieved to reveal molecular structural details. Here we demonstrate full Raman images of individual vibrational modes at the {\aa}ngstr{\"{o}}m level for a single Mg-porphine molecule, revealing distinct characteristics of each vibrational mode in real space. Furthermore, by exploiting the underlying interference effect and Raman fingerprint database, we propose a new methodology for structural determination, which we have called ‘scanning Raman picoscopy', to show how such ultrahigh-resolution spectromicroscopic vibrational images can be used to visually assemble the chemical structure of a single molecule through a simple Lego-like building process.

@doi:      10.1063/1.4824481
@abstract:
 Density-functional theory (DFT) has been widely used to study water and ice for at least 20 years. However, the reliability of different DFT exchange-correlation (xc) functionals for water remains a matter of considerable debate. This is particularly true in light of the recent development of DFT based methods that account for van der Waals (vdW) dispersion forces. Here, we report a detailed study with several xc functionals (semi-local, hybrid, and vdW inclusive approaches) on ice Ih and six proton ordered phases of ice. Consistent with our previous study [B. Santra, J. Klimeš, D. Alfè, A. Tkatchenko, B. Slater, A. Michaelides, R. Car, and M. Scheffler, Phys. Rev. Lett. 107, 185701 (2011)] which showed that vdW forces become increasingly important at high pressures, we find here that all vdW inclusive methods considered improve the relative energies and transition pressures of the high-pressure ice phases compared to those obtained with semi-local or hybrid xc functionals. However, we also find that significant discrepancies between experiment and the vdW inclusive approaches remain in the cohesive properties of the various phases, causing certain phases to be absent from the phase diagram. Therefore, room for improvement in the description of water at ambient and high pressures remains and we suggest that because of the stern test the high pressure ice phases pose they should be used in future benchmark studies of simulation methods for water.

 Classical force fields (FFs) based on machine learning (ML) methods show great potential for large scale simulations of solids.Classical force fields (FFs) based on machine learning (ML) methods show great potential for large scale simulations of solids. MLFFs have hitherto largely been designed and fitted for specific systems and are not usually transferable to chemistries beyond the specific training set. We develop a unified atomisitic line graph neural network-based FF (ALIGNN-FF) that can model both structurally and chemically diverse solids with any combination of 89 elements from the periodic table. To train the ALIGNN-FF model, we use the JARVIS-DFT dataset which contains around 75 000 materials and 4 million energy-force entries, out of which 307 113 are used in the training. We demonstrate the applicability of this method for fast optimization of atomic structures in the crystallography open database and by predicting accurate crystal structures using a genetic algorithm for alloys.

@abstract:
 Hydrodynamics is a general description for the flow of a fluid, and is expected to hold even for fundamental particles such as electrons when inter-particle interactions dominate. While various aspects of electron hydrodynamics were revealed in recent experiments, the fundamental spatial structure of hydrodynamic electrons, the Poiseuille flow profile, has remained elusive. In this work, we provide the first real-space imaging of Poiseuille flow of an electronic fluid, as well as visualization of its evolution from ballistic flow. Utilizing a scanning nanotube single electron transistor, we image the Hall voltage of electronic flow through channels of high-mobility graphene. We find that the profile of the Hall field across the channel is a key physical quantity for distinguishing ballistic from hydrodynamic flow. We image the transition from flat, ballistic field profiles at low temperature into parabolic field profiles at elevated temperatures, which is the hallmark of Poiseuille flow. The curvature of the imaged profiles is qualitatively reproduced by Boltzmann calculations, which allow us to create a 'phase diagram' that characterizes the electron flow regimes. Our results provide long-sought, direct confirmation of Poiseuille flow in the solid state, and enable a new approach for exploring the rich physics of interacting electrons in real space.

@abstract:
 Controlled manipulation of single molecules is an important step towards the fabrication of single molecule devices and nanoscale molecular machines. Currently, scanning probe microscopy (SPM) is the only technique that facilitates direct imaging and manipu- lations of nanometer-sized molecular compounds on surfaces. The technique of hand-controlled manipulation (HCM) introduced recently in Beilstein J. Nanotechnol. 2014, 5, 1926–1932 simplifies the identification of successful manipulation protocols in situ- ations when the interaction pattern of the manipulated molecule with its environment is not fully known. Here we present a further technical development that substantially improves the effectiveness of HCM. By adding Oculus Rift virtual reality goggles to our HCM set-up we provide the experimentalist with 3D visual feedback that displays the currently executed trajectory and the pos- ition of the SPM tip during manipulation in real time, while simultaneously plotting the experimentally measured frequency shift ($\Delta$f) of the non-contact atomic force microscope (NC-AFM) tuning fork sensor as well as the magnitude of the electric current (I) flowing between the tip and the surface. The advantages of the set-up are demonstrated by applying it to the model problem of the extraction of an individual PTCDA molecule from its hydrogen-bonded monolayer grown on Ag(111) surface.

 By mapping the low-energy electronic dynamics using angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), we have shed light on essential electronic characteristics of the (3 × 3) silicene phase on Ag(111) surfaces. In particular, our results show a silicene-derived band with a clear gap and linear energy-momentum dispersion near the Fermi level at the $\Gamma$ symmetry point of the (3 × 3) phase at several distinctive Brillouin zones. Moreover, we have confirmed that the large buckling of {\~{}}0.7 {\AA} of this silicene structure induces the opening of a gap close to the Fermi level higher than at least 0.3 eV, in agreement with recent reported photoemission results. The two-dimensional character of the charge carriers has also been revealed by the photon energy invariance of the gapped silicene band, suggesting a limited silicene-silver hybridization, in disagreement with recent density-functional theory (DFT) predictions.

@abstract:
 The field of molecular electronics comprises a fundamental set of issues concerning the electronic response of molecules as parts of a mesoscopic structure and a technology-facing area of science. We will overview some important aspects of these subfields. The most advanced ideas in the field involve the use of molecules as individual logic or memory units and are broadly based on using the quantum state space of the molecule. Current work in molecular electronics usually addresses molecular junction transport, where the molecule acts as a barrier for incoming electrons: This is the fundamental Landauer idea of "conduction as scattering" generalized to molecular junction structures. Another point of view in terms of superexchange as a guiding mechanism for coherent electron transfer through the molecular bridge is discussed. Molecules generally exhibit relatively strong vibronic coupling. The last section of this overview focuses on vibronic effects, including inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy, hysteresis in junction charge transport, and negative differential resistance in molecular transport junctions.

 The development of molecular-scale electronic devices has made considerable progress over the past decade, and single-molecule transistors, diodes and wires have all been demonstrated. Despite this remarkable progress, the agreement between theoretically predicted conductance values and those measured experimentally remains limited. One of the primary reasons for these discrepancies lies in the difficulty to experimentally determine the contact geometry and binding configuration of a single-molecule junction. In this Article, we apply a small-amplitude, high-frequency, sinusoidal mechanical signal to a series of single-molecule devices during junction formation and breakdown. By measuring the current response at this frequency, it is possible to determine the most probable binding and contact configurations for the molecular junction at room temperature in solution, and to obtain information about how an applied strain is distributed within the molecular junction. These results provide insight into the complex configuration of single-molecule devices, and are in excellent agreement with previous predictions from theoretical models.

@abstract:
 Colloidal quantum dot (CQD) films allow large-area solution processing and bandgap tuning through the quantum size effect. However, the high ratio of surface area to volume makes CQD films prone to high trap state densities if surfaces are imperfectly passivated, promoting recombination of charge carriers that is detrimental to device performance. Recent advances have replaced the long insulating ligands that enable colloidal stability following synthesis with shorter organic linkers or halide anions, leading to improved passivation and higher packing densities. Although this substitution has been performed using solid-state ligand exchange, a solution-based approach is preferable because it enables increased control over the balance of charges on the surface of the quantum dot, which is essential for eliminating midgap trap states. Furthermore, the solution-based approach leverages recent progress in metal:chalcogen chemistry in the liquid phase. Here, we quantify the density of midgap trap states in CQD solids and show that the performance of CQD-based photovoltaics is now limited by electron-hole recombination due to these states. Next, using density functional theory and optoelectronic device modelling, we show that to improve this performance it is essential to bind a suitable ligand to each potential trap site on the surface of the quantum dot. We then develop a robust hybrid passivation scheme that involves introducing halide anions during the end stages of the synthesis process, which can passivate trap sites that are inaccessible to much larger organic ligands. An organic crosslinking strategy is then used to form the film. Finally, we use our hybrid passivated CQD solid to fabricate a solar cell with a certified efficiency of 7.0{\%}, which is a record for a CQD photovoltaic device.

@abstract:
 Visualizing individual molecules with chemical recognition is a longstanding target in catalysis, molecular nanotechnology and biotechnology. Molecular vibrations provide a valuable 'fingerprint' for such identification. Vibrational spectroscopy based on tip-enhanced Raman scattering allows us to access the spectral signals of molecular species very efficiently via the strong localized plasmonic fields produced at the tip apex. However, the best spatial resolution of the tip-enhanced Raman scattering imaging is still limited to 3-15 nanometres, which is not adequate for resolving a single molecule chemically. Here we demonstrate Raman spectral imaging with spatial resolution below one nanometre, resolving the inner structure and surface configuration of a single molecule. This is achieved by spectrally matching the resonance of the nanocavity plasmon to the molecular vibronic transitions, particularly the downward transition responsible for the emission of Raman photons. This matching is made possible by the extremely precise tuning capability provided by scanning tunnelling microscopy. Experimental evidence suggests that the highly confined and broadband nature of the nanocavity plasmon field in the tunnelling gap is essential for ultrahigh-resolution imaging through the generation of an efficient double-resonance enhancement for both Raman excitation and Raman emission. Our technique not only allows for chemical imaging at the single-molecule level, but also offers a new way to study the optical processes and photochemistry of a single molecule.

@abstract:
 In this paper, a systematic derivation of the tunneling matrix elements in three-dimensional space is presented. Based on a modified Bardeen tunneling theory, explicit expressions for the tunneling matrix elements for localized tip states are derived with use of the Green's-function method. It is shown that by expanding the vacuum tail of the tip wave function in terms of spherical harmonics, the tunneling matrix elements are related to the derivatives of the sample wave functions at the nucleus of the apex atom (taken as the center of the spherical-harmonics expansion), in a simple and straightforward way. In addition, an independent derivation based on a general sum rule is also presented, which is valid in a number of curvilinear coordinate systems. In spherical coordinates, a general form of the derivative rule follows. In parabolic coordinates, similar results are obtained. Physical meanings of these matrix elements, as well as their implications to the imaging mechanism of scanning-tunneling microscopy, are discussed.

@abstract:
 A capsule is a group of neurons whose activity vector represents the instantiation parameters of a specific type of entity such as an object or object part. We use the length of the activity vector to represent the probability that the entity exists and its orientation to represent the instantiation paramters. Active capsules at one level make predictions, via transformation matrices, for the instantiation parameters of higher-level capsules. When multiple predictions agree, a higher level capsule becomes active. We show that a discrimininatively trained, multi-layer capsule system achieves state-of-the-art performance on MNIST and is considerably better than a convolutional net at recognizing highly overlapping digits. To achieve these results we use an iterative routing-by-agreement mechanism: A lower-level capsule prefers to send its output to higher level capsules whose activity vectors have a big scalar product with the prediction coming from the lower-level capsule.

@doi:      10.18260/1-2--19991
@url:      http://peer.asee.org/19991
@abstract:
 A graduate course focused on bringing cutting edge research into the classroom, titled Nuclear Pumped Lasers and applications, was taught at the University of Missouri in 1991 as a topics course; due to renewed interests in high power/high energy lasers for civilian applications, the course has been updated with new research and is being offered in the spring of 2014. Nuclear-Pumped Laser (NPL) technology was a part of the strategic defense initiative (SDI) program in the 1980's. NPLs have since faded from the United States research agenda but they remain an active part of the research agenda in other countries, notably in Russia and other nations in the former Soviet Union as well as China [1] which has a cooperative agreement with Russia [2]. The reason for this broad interest in the technology is that a NPL can scale to high power/energy levels (potentially up to 100 MW Continuous Wave (CW) beam power). Military applications have historically dominated the NPL research agenda. However, there are significant humanitarian applications for high power/energy lasers. For example a high power CW NPL would have the capability to deflect asteroids or comets. Other important applications are in space propulsion, power transmission, and asteroid mining. Despite the promise, there are significant problems in NPL development [3, 4]. High power/high energy gas lasers by their nature require high pumping power densities (defined as the Watts/cm3 deposited in the laser medium). That is why many of the most powerful gas lasers are pulsed. Nuclear-pumping does not generate high power densities as compared to electrical pumping, but it does generate high energy densities. This limits the type of high power/high energy gas laser systems that can be driven by NPL technologies. Other issues involve the size and scale of NPLs using gas laser technology as well as the design of reactor cores dedicated to the production of laser beams. Several promising approaches were developed including the development of nuclear-driven flashlamps [5] which can increase the effective pumping power density through photon focusing and thus open up new possibilities for both gaseous and solid-state high power/high energy laser systems. {\textcopyright} American Society for Engineering Education, 2014.

@abstract:
 In contrast to the approach commonly taken by chemists, nature controls chemical reactivity by modulating the effective molarity of highly dilute reactants through macromolecule-templated synthesis. Nature's approach enables complex mixtures in a single solution to react with efficiencies and selectivities that cannot be achieved in conventional laboratory synthesis. DNA-templated organic synthesis (DTS) is emerging as a surprisingly general way to control the reactivity of synthetic molecules by using nature's effective-molarity-based approach. Recent developments have expanded the scope and capabilities of DTS from its origins as a model of prebiotic nucleic acid replication to its current ability to translate DNA sequences into complex small-molecule and polymer products of multistep organic synthesis. An understanding of fundamental principles underlying DTS has played an important role in these developments. Early applications of DTS include nucleic acid sensing, small-molecule discovery, and reaction discovery with the help of translation, selection, and amplification methods previously available only to biological molecules.

 One route for assembling three-dimensional (3D) DNA nanostructures is to start with a long natural DNA single strand and attach short strands, or “staples,” that cause the entire “origami” structure to fold into a desired shape. Ke et al. (p. 1177 , see the cover; see the Perspective by Gothelf ) present an alternative approach to 3D assembly that builds upon modular assembly of 2D DNA tiles. One hundred and two distinct shapes were created from four-domain, 32-nucleotide single-stranded DNAs that assembled like children's blocks; each block could bind to four neighboring blocks through specific pairing interactions. Computer design and stepwise assembly allowed assembly of hollow shapes with a variety of internal cavities.

 The arrangement of atoms and bonds in a molecule influences its physical and chemical properties. The scanning tunneling microscope can provide electronic and vibrational signatures of single molecules. However, these signatures do not relate simply to the molecular structure and bonding. We constructed an inelastic tunneling probe based on the scanning tunneling microscope to sense the local potential energy landscape of an adsorbed molecule with a carbon monoxide (CO)–terminated tip. The skeletal structure and bonding of the molecule are revealed from imaging the spatial variations of a CO vibration as the CO-terminated tip probes the core of the interactions between adjacent atoms. An application of the inelastic tunneling probe reveals the sharing of hydrogen atoms among multiple centers in intramolecular and extramolecular bonding.

@abstract:
 The purpose of this review is to compare and discuss recent experimental and theoretical results in the field of H2O-solid interactions. We emphasize studies of low (submonolayer) coverages of water on well-characterized, single-crystal surfaces of metals, semiconductors and oxides. We discuss the factors which influence dissociative versus associative adsorption pathways. When H2O adsorbs molecularly, it tends to form three-dimensional hydrogen-bonded clusters, even at fractional monolayer coverages, because the strength of the attractive interaction between two molecules is comparable to that of the substrate-H2O bond. The template effect of the substrate is important in determining both the local orientation and long-range order of H2O molecules in these clusters. The influence of surface additive atoms (e.g., O, Br, Na, K) and also surface imperfections (e.g. steps and defects) on the surface structure and chemistry of H2O is examined in detail. Some results on single-crystal substrates are compared with earlier measurements of H2O adsorption on high-area materials.

 It is textbook knowledge that in order to dissolve rock salt in liquid water at ambient conditions at least nine water molecules per salt molecule are needed. An obvious but until now unsolved question arises:? How many water molecules are necessary to solvate a single sodium chloride molecule? In other words, what is the smallest water cluster in which a solvent separated Na+/Cl- ion pair becomes stabilized? The answer, based on accurate quantum chemical calculations, is that simple extrapolation from the liquid is quantitatively wrong and that the hexamer represents the smallest water species that dissolves the NaCl molecule.

 The tip of a scanning tunneling microscope can be chemically modified by transferring a single molecule from the surface. Such a molecule-terminated tip yields enhanced resolution in topographical imaging of substrate atoms and molecular orbitals of molecules adsorbed on the surface. In addition, vibrational modes are detected in single molecule inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy which are not observed with a bare tip. These new findings are revealed by transferring a carbon monoxide or an ethylene molecule to the tip and probing single carbon monoxide and oxygen molecules adsorbed on Ag(110) at 13 K.

 Supramolecular chemistry on a surface has produced a large variety of atomically controlled systems, but practical applications are seriously restricted by the use of weakly cohesive non-covalent bonds and by the confinement to a metal surface. Here we report on the formation of a well-ordered organometallic sheet consisting of two-dimensional polymeric phthalocyanine. Remarkably, the growth demonstrated on a metal surface can be extended onto a thin insulating film. We thus expect the intrinsic properties to be preserved, and the system should be easily transferable to real devices.

@abstract:
 A central challenge in nanotechnology is the parallel fabrication of complex geometries for nanodevices. Here we report a general method for arranging single-walled carbon nanotubes in two dimensions using DNA origami-a technique in which a long single strand of DNA is folded into a predetermined shape. We synthesize rectangular origami templates ( approximately 75 nm x 95 nm) that display two lines of single-stranded DNA 'hooks' in a cross pattern with approximately 6 nm resolution. The perpendicular lines of hooks serve as sequence-specific binding sites for two types of nanotubes, each functionalized non-covalently with a distinct DNA linker molecule. The hook-binding domain of each linker is protected to ensure efficient hybridization. When origami templates and DNA-functionalized nanotubes are mixed, strand displacement-mediated deprotection and binding aligns the nanotubes into cross-junctions. Of several cross-junctions synthesized by this method, one demonstrated stable field-effect transistor-like behaviour. In such organizations of electronic components, DNA origami serves as a programmable nanobreadboard; thus, DNA origami may allow the rapid prototyping of complex nanotube-based structures.

@abstract:
 A two-dimensional (2D) periodic Fe phthalocyanine (FePc) single-layer sheet has very recently been synthesized experimentally (Abel, M.; et al. J. Am. Chem. Soc.2011, 133, 1203), providing a novel pathway for achieving 2D atomic sheets with regularly and separately distributed transition-metal atoms for unprecedented applications. Here we present first-principles calculations based on density functional theory to investigate systematically the electronic and magnetic properties of such novel organometallics (labeled as TMPc, TM = Cr-Zn) as free-standing sheets. Among them, we found that only the 2D MnPc framework is ferromagnetic, while 2D CrPc, FePc, CoPc, and CuPc are antiferromagnetic and 2D NiPc and ZnPc are nonmagnetic. The difference in magnetic couplings for the studied systems is related to the different orbital interactions. Only MnPc displays metallic d xz and d yz orbitals that can hybridize with p electrons of Pc, which mediates the long-range ferromagnetic coupling. Monte Carlo simulations based on the Ising model suggest that the Curie temperature (T C) of the 2D MnPc framework is ∼150 K, which is comparable to the highest T C achieved experimentally, that of Mn-doped GaAs. The present study provides theoretical insight leading to a better understanding of novel phthalocyanine-based 2D structures beyond graphene and BN sheets. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Chemical Society.

@doi:      10.1093/nar/gkj491
@abstract:
 Tertiary interactions are crucial in maintaining the tRNA structure and functionality. We used a combined sequence analysis and quantum mechanics approach to calculate accurate energies of the most frequent tRNA tertiary base pairing interactions. Our analysis indicates that six out of the nine classical tertiary interactions are held in place mainly by H-bonds between the bases. In the remaining three cases other effects have to be considered. Tertiary base pairing interaction energies range from -8 to -38 kcal/mol in yeast tRNAPhe and are estimated to contribute roughly 25{\%} of the overall tRNA base pairing interaction energy. Six analyzed posttranslational chemical modifications were shown to have minor effect on the geometry of the tertiary interactions. Modifications that introduce a positive charge strongly stabilize the corresponding tertiary interactions. Non-additive effects contribute to the stability of base triplets. {\textcopyright} 2006 Oxford University Press.

 Graphene has exceptional mechanical and electronic properties, but its hydrophobic nature is a disadvantage in biologically related applications. Amyloid fibrils are naturally occurring protein aggregates that are stable in solution or under highly hydrated conditions, have well-organized supramolecular structures and outstanding strength. Here, we show that graphene and amyloid fibrils can be combined to create a new class of biodegradable composite materials with adaptable properties. This new composite material is inexpensive, highly conductive and can be degraded by enzymes. Furthermore, it can reversibly change shape in response to variations in humidity, and can be used in the design of biosensors for quantifying the activity of enzymes. The properties of the composite can be fine-tuned by changing the graphene-to-amyloid ratio.

@abstract:
 Most of today's molecular-dynamics simulations of materials are based on the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. There are many cases, however, in which the coupling of the electrons and nuclei is important and it is necessary to go beyond the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. In these methods, the non-adiabatic coupling vectors are fundamental since they represent the link between the classical atomic motion of the nuclei and the time evolution of the quantum electronic state. In this paper we analyze the calculation of non-adiabatic coupling vectors in a basis set of local orbitals and derive an expression to calculate them in a practical and computationally efficient way. Some examples of the application of this expression using a local-orbital density functional theory approach are presented for a few simple molecules: H3, formaldimine, and azobenzene. These results show that the approach presented here, using the Slater transition-state density, is a very promising way for the practical calculation of non-adiabatic coupling vectors for large systems.

 Following on from the earlier work of Pulay and Fogarasi [J. Chem. Phys. 96, 2856 (1992)] we present an alternative definition of natural internal coordinates. This set of delocalized internal coordinates can be generated for any molecular topology, no matter how complicated, and is fully nonredundant. Using an appropriate Schmidt-orthogonalization procedure, all standard bond length, bond angle, and dihedral angle constraints can be imposed within our internal coordinate scheme. Combinatorial constraints (in which sums or differences of stretches, bends, and torsions remain constant) can also be imposed. Optimizations on some fairly large systems (50-100 atoms) show that delocalized internal coordinates are far superior to Cartesians even with reliable Hessian information available at the starting geometry.

@abstract:
 Within the harmonic approximation to transition state theory, the rate of escape from a reactant is calculated from local information at saddle points on the boundary of the state. The dimer minimum-mode following method can be used to find such saddle points. But as we show, dimer searches that are initiated from a reactant state of interest can converge to saddles that are not on the boundary of the reactant state. These disconnected saddles are not directly useful for calculating the escape rate. Additionally, the ratio of disconnected saddles can be large, especially when the dimer searches are initiated far from the reactant minimum. The reason that the method finds disconnected saddles is a result of the fact that the dimer method tracks local ridges, defined as the set of points where the force is perpendicular to the negative curvature mode, and not the true ridge, defined as the boundary of the set of points which minimize to the reactant. The local ridges tend to deviate from the true ridge away from saddle points. Furthermore, the local ridge can be discontinuous and have holes which allow the dimer to cross the true ridge and escape the initial state. To solve this problem, we employ an alternative definition of a local ridge based upon the minimum directional curvature of the isopotential hyperplane, $\kappa$, which provides additional local information to tune the dimer dynamics. We find that hyperplanes of $\kappa$ = 0 pass through all saddle points but rarely intersect with the true ridge elsewhere. By restraining the dimer within the $\kappa$ {\textless} 0 region, the probability of converging to disconnected saddles is significantly reduced and the efficiency of finding connected saddles is increased.

@abstract:
 On-surface chemical reactions hold the potential for manufacturing nanoscale structures directly onto surfaces by linking carbon atoms in a single-step reaction. To fabricate more complex and functionalized structures, the control of the on-surface chemical reactions must be developed significantly. Here, we present a thermally controlled sequential three-step chemical transformation of a hydrocarbon molecule on a Cu(111) surface. With a combination of high-resolution atomic force microscopy and first-principles computations, we investigate the transformation process in step-by-step detail from the initial structure to the final product via two intermediate states. The results demonstrate that surfaces can be used as catalysing templates to obtain compounds, which cannot easily be synthesized by solution chemistry.

@abstract:
 Modeling many-body quantum systems with strong interactions is one of the core challenges of modern physics. A range of methods has been developed to approach this task, each with its own idiosyncrasies, approximations, and realm of applicability. However, there remain many problems that are intractable for existing methods. In particular, many approaches face a huge computational barrier when modeling large numbers of coupled electrons and ions at finite temperature. Here, we address this shortfall with a new approach to modeling many-body quantum systems. On the basis of the Bohmian trajectory formalism, our new method treats the full particle dynamics with a considerable increase in computational speed. As a result, we are able to perform large-scale simulations of coupled electron-ion systems without using the adiabatic Born-Oppenheimer approximation.

@abstract:
 Quantum confined silicon nanocrystals (Si-ncs) exhibit intriguing properties due to silicon's indirect bandgap and their highly reactive surfaces. In particular the interplay of quantum confinement with surface effects reveals a complex scenario, which can complicate the interpretation of Si-nc properties and prediction of their corresponding behaviour. At the same time, the complexity and interplay of the different mechanisms in Si-ncs offer great opportunities with characteristics that may not be achievable with other nano-systems. In this context, a variety of carefully surface-engineered Si-ncs are highly desirable both for improving our understanding of Si-nc photo-physics and for their successful integration in application devices. Here we firstly highlight a selection of theoretical efforts and experimental surface engineering approaches and secondly we focus on recent surface engineering results that have utilized novel plasma-liquid interactions.

@abstract:
 The formation of extended electron states in one-dimensional nanostructures is of key importance for the function of molecular electronics devices. Here we study the effects of strong electron-phonon interaction on the formation of extended electronic states in intentionally created Cl vacancy pairs and chains in a NaCl bilayer on Cu(111). The interaction between the vacancies was tailored by fabricating vacancy pairs and chains of different orientation and separation with atomic precision using vertical manipulation. Small separation of divacancies led to the formation of symmetric and antisymmetric vacancy states and localized interface-states. By scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) we measured their energy splitting and broadening as a function of the inter-vacancy separation. Unexpectedly, the energy splitting between the vacancy states is enlarged by level repulsion resulting from phonon dressing of the electronic states, as evidenced by theory. Already for a few coupled vacancies we observe an emerging band structure of the defect band.

 Carbon monoxide mols. were arranged in atomically precise configurations, which we call $\backslash$"mol. cascades,$\backslash$" where the motion of one mol. causes the subsequent motion of another, and so on in a cascade of motion similar to a row of toppling dominoes. Isotopically pure cascades were assembled on a copper (111) surface with a low-temp. scanning tunneling microscope. The hopping rate of carbon monoxide mols. in cascades was found to be independent of temp. below 6 K and to exhibit a pronounced isotope effect, hallmarks of a quantum tunneling process. At higher temps., we obsd. a thermally activated hopping rate with an anomalously low Arrhenius prefactor that we interpret as tunneling from excited vibrational states. We present a cascade-based computation scheme that has all of the devices and interconnects required for the one-time computation of an arbitrary logic function. Logic gates and other devices were implemented by engineered arrangements of mols. at the intersections of cascades. We demonstrate a three-input sorter that uses several AND gates and OR gates, as well as the crossover and fan-out units needed to connect them.

 In supernova cores and neutron star crusts, nuclei with exotic shapes such as rod-like and slab-like nuclei are expected to exist. These nuclei are collectively called nuclear "pasta". For the past decades, existence of the pasta phases in the equilibrium state has been studied using various methods. Recently, the formation process of the pasta phases, which has been a long-standing problem, has been unveiled using molecular dynamics simulations. In this review, we first provide the astrophysical background of supernovae and neutron stars and overview the history of the study of the pasta phases. We then focus on the recent study on the formation process of the pasta phases. Finally, we discuss future important issues related to the pasta phases: their astrophysical evidence and consequences.

@abstract:
 A systematic examination of noncovalent interactions as modeled by wavefunction theory is presented in comparison to gold-standard quality benchmarks available for 345 interaction energies of 49 bimolecular complexes. Quantum chemical techniques examined include spin-component-scaling (SCS) variations on second-order perturbation theory (MP2) [SCS, SCS(N), SCS(MI)] and coupled cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) [SCS, SCS(MI)]; also, method combinations designed to improve dispersion contacts [DW-MP2, MP2C, MP2.5, DW-CCSD(T)-F12]; where available, explicitly correlated (F12) counterparts are also considered. Dunning basis sets augmented by diffuse functions are employed for all accessible $\zeta$-levels; truncations of the diffuse space are also considered. After examination of both accuracy and performance for 394 model chemistries, SCS(MI)-MP2/cc-pVQZ can be recommended for general use, having good accuracy at low cost and no ill-effects such as imbalance between hydrogen-bonding and dispersion-dominated systems or non-parallelity across dissociation curves. Moreover, when benchmarking accuracy is desirable but gold-standard computations are unaffordable, this work recommends silver-standard [DW-CCSD(T)-F12/aug-cc-pVDZ] and bronze-standard [MP2C-F12/aug-cc-pVDZ] model chemistries, which support accuracies of 0.05 and 0.16 kcal/mol and efficiencies of 97.3 and 5.5 h for adenine{\textperiodcentered}thymine, respectively.

The complexity of this technique calls for a new theoretical approach where relaxation of functionalized probe is considered in both AFM and STM modes. We describe mechanisms responsible for the high-resolution contrast introducing a numerical model, which provides deeper understanding of the AFM/STM measurements.

@abstract:
 Biological protein materials (BPMs), intriguing hierarchical structures formed by assembly of chemical building blocks, are crucial for critical functions of life. The structural details of BPMs are fascinating: They represent a combination of universally found motifs such as alpha-helices or beta-sheets with highly adapted protein structures such as cytoskeletal networks or spider silk nanocomposites. BPMs combine properties like strength and robustness, self-healing ability, adaptability, changeability, evolvability and others into multi-functional materials at a level unmatched in synthetic materials. The ability to achieve these properties depends critically on the particular traits of these materials, first and foremost their hierarchical architecture and seamless integration of material and structure, from nano to macro. Here, we provide a brief review of this field and outline new research directions, along with a review of recent research results in the development of structure-property relationships of biological protein materials exemplified in a study of vimentin intermediate filaments.

@abstract:
 We review our achievements in exploring the high resolution imaging of scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) on the surface and adsorbates in a ultra-high vacuum system, by modifying the STM tip or introducing a decoupled layer onto the substrate. With an ultra-sharp tip, the highest resolution of Si(1 1 1)-7 × 7 reconstruction can be achieved, in which all the rest atoms and adatoms are observed simultaneously with high contrast. Further functionalization of STM tips can realize selective imaging of inherent molecular states. The electronic states of perylene and metal-phthalocyanine molecules are resolved with special decorated tips on metal substrates at low temperature. Moreover, we present two kinds of buffer layer: an organic molecular layer and epitaxially grown graphene to decouple the molecular electronic structure from the influence of the underlying metallic substrate and allow the direct imaging of the intrinsic orbitals of the adsorbed molecules. Theoretical calculations and STM simulations, based on first-principle density function theory, are performed in order to understand and verify the mechanism of high-resolution images. We propose that our results provide impactful routes to pursue the goal of higher resolution, more detailed information and extensive properties for future STM applications.

@doi:      10.1038/nature20101
@abstract:
 Modern computers separate computation and memory. Computation is performed by a processor, which can use an addressable memory to bring operands in and out of play. This confers two important benefits: the use of extensible storage to write new information and the ability to treat the contents of memory as variables. Variables are critical to algorithm generality: to perform the same procedure on one datum or another, an algorithm merely has to change the address it reads from. In contrast to computers, the computational and memory resources of artificial neural networks are mixed together in the network weights and neuron activity. This is a major liability: as the memory demands of a task increase, these networks cannot allocate new storage dynam-ically, nor easily learn algorithms that act independently of the values realized by the task variables. Although recent breakthroughs demonstrate that neural networks are remarkably adept at sensory processing 1 , sequence learning 2,3 and reinforcement learning 4 , cognitive scientists and neuroscientists have argued that neural networks are limited in their ability to represent variables and data structures 5–9 , and to store data over long timescales without interference 10,11 . We aim to combine the advantages of neu-ral and computational processing by providing a neural network with read–write access to external memory. The access is narrowly focused, minimizing interference among memoranda and enabling long-term storage 12,13 . The whole system is differentiable, and can therefore be trained end-to-end with gradient descent, allowing the network to learn how to operate and organize the memory in a goal-directed manner.

@abstract:
 Rapid progress in machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) has brought increasing attention to the potential impacts of AI technologies on society. In this paper we discuss one such potential impact: the problem of accidents in machine learning systems, defined as unintended and harmful behavior that may emerge from poor design of real-world AI systems. We present a list of five practical research problems related to accident risk, categorized according to whether the problem originates from having the wrong objective function ("avoiding side effects" and "avoiding reward hacking"), an objective function that is too expensive to evaluate frequently ("scalable supervision"), or undesirable behavior during the learning process ("safe exploration" and "distributional shift"). We review previous work in these areas as well as suggesting research directions with a focus on relevance to cutting-edge AI systems. Finally, we consider the high-level question of how to think most productively about the safety of forward-looking applications of AI.

@abstract:
 The dissolution of NaCl in water is one of the most common everyday processes, yet it remains poorly understood at the molecular level. Here we report the results of an extensive density functional theory study in which the initial stages of NaCl dissolution have been examined at low water coverages. Our specific approach is to study how the energetic cost of moving an ion or a pair of ions to a less coordinated site at the surface of various NaCl crystals varies with the number of water molecules adsorbed on the surface. This "microsolvation" approach allows us to study the dependence of the defect energies on the number of water molecules in the cluster and thus to establish when and where dissolution becomes favorable. Moreover, this approach allows us to understand the roles of the individual ions and water molecules in the dissolution process. Consistent with previous work we identify a clear preference for dissolution of Cl ions over Na ions. However, the detailed information obtained here leads to the conclusion that the process is governed by the higher affinity of the water molecules to Na ions than to Cl ions. The Cl ions are released first as this exposes more Na ions at the surface creating favorable adsorption sites for water. We discuss how this mechanism is likely to be effective for other alkali halides.

 B3LYP/aug-cc-pVTZ calculations were performed on the species with intramolecular O-H⋯O hydrogen bonds. The Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules (QTAIM) and the Electron Localization Function (ELF) method were applied to analyze these interactions. Numerous relationships between ELF and QTAIM parameters were found. It is interesting that the CVB index based on the ELF method as well as the total electron energy density at the bond critical point of the proton-acceptor distance (Hbcp) may be treated as universal descriptors of the hydrogen bond strength, they are also useful to estimate the covalent character of this interaction. There are so-called resonance-assisted hydrogen bonds (RAHBs) among the species analyzed here. It was found that there are not any distinct differences between RAHBs and the other intramolecular hydrogen bonds. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Chemical Society.

@abstract:
 With the rapid development of scanning probe microscopy, it has become possible to study polymerization processes on suitable surfaces at the atomic level and in real space. In the two-dimensional confinement of a surface, polymerization reactions can give rise to the formation of unprecedented polymers with unique structures and properties, not accessible in solution. After a little over one decade since the discovery of covalent on-surface polymerization, we give an overview of the field, analyse the crucial aspects and critically reflect on the status quo. Specifically, we provide some general considerations about fundamental mechanisms as well as kinetics and thermodynamics of on-surface polymerization processes. The important role of the surface is detailed in view of its ability to control polymer formation with regard to structure, dimensionality and composition. Furthermore, examples that allow for locally induced polymerization are highlighted. Finally, we provide an analysis of scientific challenges in the field and outline future prospects.

@abstract:
 The association of two biological macromolecules is a fundamental biological phenomenon and an unsolved theoretical problem. Docking methods for ab initio prediction of association of two independently determined protein structures usually fail when they are applied to a large set of complexes, mostly because of inaccuracies in the scoring function and/or difficulties on simulating the rearrangement of the interface residues on binding. In this work we present an efficient pseudo-Brownian rigid-body docking procedure followed by Biased Probability Monte Carlo Minimization of the ligand interacting side-chains. The use of a soft interaction energy function precalculated on a grid, instead of the explicit energy, drastically increased the speed of the procedure. The method was tested on a benchmark of 24 protein–protein complexes in which the three-dimensional structures of their subunits (bound and free) were available. The rank of the near-native conformation in a list of candidate docking solutions was {\textless}20 in 85{\%} of complexes with no major backbone motion on binding. Among them, as many as 7 out of 11 (64{\%}) protease-inhibitor complexes can be successfully predicted as the highest rank conformations. The presented method can be further refined to include the binding site predictions and applied to the structures generated by the structural proteomics projects. All scripts are available on the Web.

@abstract:
 The emergence of catalysis in early genetic polymers such as RNA is considered a key transition in the origin of life, pre-dating the appearance of protein enzymes. DNA also demonstrates the capacity to fold into three-dimensional structures and form catalysts in vitro. However, to what degree these natural biopolymers comprise functionally privileged chem. scaffolds for folding or the evolution of catalysis is not known. The ability of synthetic genetic polymers (XNAs) with alternative backbone chemistries not found in nature to fold into defined structures and bind ligands raises the possibility that these too might be capable of forming catalysts (XNAzymes). Here we report the discovery of such XNAzymes, elaborated in four different chemistries (arabino nucleic acids, ANA; 2'-fluoroarabino nucleic acids, FANA; hexitol nucleic acids, HNA; and cyclohexene nucleic acids, CeNA) directly from random XNA oligomer pools, exhibiting in trans RNA endonuclease and ligase activities. We also describe an XNA-XNA ligase metalloenzyme in the FANA framework, establishing catalysis in an entirely synthetic system and enabling the synthesis of FANA oligomers and an active RNA endonuclease FANAzyme from its constituent parts. These results extend catalysis beyond biopolymers and establish technologies for the discovery of catalysts in a wide range of polymer scaffolds not found in nature. Evolution of catalysis independent of any natural polymer has implications for the definition of chem. boundary conditions for the emergence of life on Earth and elsewhere in the Universe.

@abstract:
 Van der Waals (vdW) forces act ubiquitously in condensed matter. Despite being weak on an atomic level, they substantially influence molecular and biological systems due to their long range and system-size scaling. The difficulty to isolate and measure vdW forces on a single-molecule level causes our present understanding to be strongly theory based. Here we show measurements of the attractive potential between differently sized organic molecules and a metal surface using an atomic force microscope. Our choice of molecules and the large molecule-surface separation cause this attraction to be purely of vdW type. The experiment allows testing the asymptotic vdW force law and its validity range. We find a superlinear growth of the vdW attraction with molecular size, originating from the increased deconfinement of electrons in the molecules. Because such non-additive vdW contributions are not accounted for in most first-principles or empirical calculations, we suggest further development in that direction.

 Fast, cheap, and reliable DNA sequencing could be one of the most disruptive innovations of this decade, as it will pave the way for personalized medicine. In pursuit of such technology, a variety of nanotechnology-based approaches have been explored and established, including sequencing with nanopores. Owing to its unique structure and properties, graphene provides interesting opportunities for the development of a new sequencing technology. In recent years, a wide range of creative ideas for graphene sequencers have been theoretically proposed and the first experimental demonstrations have begun to appear. Here, we review the different approaches to using graphene nanodevices for DNA sequencing, which involve DNA passing through graphene nanopores, nanogaps, and nanoribbons, and the physisorption of DNA on graphene nanostructures. We discuss the advantages and problems of each of these key techniques, and provide a perspective on the use of graphene in future DNA sequencing technology.$\backslash$nView full text

@abstract:
 Properties of two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides are highly sensitive to the presence of defects in the crystal structure. A detailed understanding of defect structure may lead to control of material properties through defect engineering. Here we provide direct evidence for the existence of isolated, one-dimensional charge density waves at mirror twin boundaries in single-layer MoSe2. Our low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy measurements reveal a substantial bandgap of 60 - 140 meV opening at the Fermi level in the otherwise one dimensional metallic structure. We find an energy-dependent periodic modulation in the density of states along the mirror twin boundary, with a wavelength of approximately three lattice constants. The modulations in the density of states above and below the Fermi level are spatially out of phase, consistent with charge density wave order. In addition to the electronic characterization, we determine the atomic structure and bonding configuration of the one-dimensional mirror twin boundary by means of high-resolution non-contact atomic force microscopy. Density functional theory calculations reproduce both the gap opening and the modulations of the density of states.

@abstract:
 A force microscope operated with an amplitude modulation feedback (usually known as tapping-mode atomic force microscope) has two tip-sample interaction regimes, attractive and repulsive. We have studied the performance of those regimes to imaging single antibody molecules. The attractive interaction regime allows determination of the basic morphologies of the antibodies on the support. More importantly, this regime is able to resolve the characteristic Y-shaped domain structure of antibodies and the hinge region between domains. Imaging in the repulsive interaction regime is associated with the irreversible deformation of the molecules. This causes a significant loss in resolution and contrast. Two major physical differences distinguish the repulsive interaction regime from the attractive interaction regime: the existence of tip-sample contact and the strength of the forces involved.

@abstract:
 A simplified approach to treating the electron correlation energy is suggested in which only the $\alpha$-$\beta$ component of the second order M{\o}ller-Plesset energy is evaluated, and then scaled by an empirical factor which is suggested to be 1.3. This scaled opposite-spin second order energy (SOS-MP2), where MP2 is M{\o}ller-Plesset theory, yields results for relative energies and derivative properties that are statistically improved over the conventional MP2 method. Furthermore, the SOS-MP2 energy can be evaluated without the fifth order computational steps associated with MP2 theory, even without exploiting any spatial locality. A fourth order algorithm is given for evaluating the opposite spin MP2 energy using auxiliary basis expansions, and a Laplace approach, and timing comparisons are given. {\textcopyright} 2004 American Institute of Physics.

@abstract:
 Understanding the unique properties of water still represents a significant challenge for theory and experiment. Computer simulations by molecular dynamics require a reliable description of the atomic interactions, and in recent decades countless water potentials have been reported in the literature. Still, most of these potentials contain significant approximations, for instance a frozen internal structure of the individual water monomers.Artificial neural networks (NNs) offer a promising way for the construction of very accurate potential-energysurfaces taking all degrees of freedom explicitly into account. These potentials are based on electronic structure calculations for representative configurations, which are then interpolated to a continuous energy surface that can be evaluated many orders of magnitude faster. We present a full-dimensional NN potential for the water dimer as a first step towards the construction of a NN potential for liquid water. This many-body potential is based on environment-dependent atomic energy contributions, and long-range electrostatic interactions are incorporated employing environment-dependent atomic charges. We show that the potential and derived properties like vibrational frequencies are in excellent agreement with the underlying reference density-functional theory calculations.

@abstract:
 Virtually all known fluorophores, including semiconductor nanoparticles, nanorods and nanowires exhibit unexplainable episodes of intermittent emission blinking. A most remarkable feature of the fluorescence intermittency is a universal power law distribution of on- and off-times. For nanoparticles the resulting power law extends over an extraordinarily wide dynamic range: nine orders of magnitude in probability density and five to six orders of magnitude in time. The exponents hover about the ubiquitous value of -3/2. Dark states routinely last for tens of seconds, which are practically forever on quantum mechanical time scales. Despite such infinite states of darkness, the dots miraculously recover and start emitting again. Although the underlying mechanism responsible for this phenomenon remains an enduring mystery and many questions remain, we argue that substantial theoretical progress has been made.

@abstract:
 We describe a global optimization technique using `basin-hopping' in which the potential energy surface is transformed into a collection of interpenetrating staircases. This method has been designed to exploit the features which recent work suggests must be present in an energy landscape for efficient relaxation to the global minimum. The transformation associates any point in configuration space with the local minimum obtained by a geometry optimization started from that point, effectively removing transition state regions from the problem. However, unlike other methods based upon hypersurface deformation, this transformation does not change the global minimum. The lowest known structures are located for all Lennard-Jones clusters up to 110 atoms, including a number that have never been found before in unbiased searches.

@abstract:
 Scanning probe microscopes can be used to image and chemically characterize surfaces down to the atomic scale. However, the localized tip-sample interactions in scanning probe microscopes limit high-resolution images to the topmost atomic layer of surfaces, and characterizing the inner structures of materials and biomolecules is a challenge for such instruments. Here, we show that an atomic force microscope can be used to image and three-dimensionally reconstruct chemical groups inside a protein complex. We use short single-stranded DNAs as imaging labels that are linked to target regions inside a protein complex, and T-shaped atomic force microscope cantilevers functionalized with complementary probe DNAs allow the labels to be located with sequence specificity and subnanometre resolution. After measuring pairwise distances between labels, we reconstruct the three-dimensional structure formed by the target chemical groups within the protein complex using simple geometric calculations. Experiments with the biotin-streptavidin complex show that the predicted three-dimensional loci of the carboxylic acid groups of biotins are within 2 {\AA} of their respective loci in the corresponding crystal structure, suggesting that scanning probe microscopes could complement existing structural biological techniques in solving structures that are difficult to study due to their size and complexity.

@abstract:
 Metal ions play significant roles in numerous fields including chemistry, geochemistry, biochemistry, and materials science. With computational tools increasingly becoming important in chemical research, methods have emerged to effectively face the challenge of modeling metal ions in the gas, aqueous, and solid phases. Herein, we review both quantum and classical modeling strategies for metal ion-containing systems that have been developed over the past few decades. This Review focuses on classical metal ion modeling based on unpolarized models (including the nonbonded, bonded, cationic dummy atom, and combined models), polarizable models (e.g., the fluctuating charge, Drude oscillator, and the induced dipole models), the angular overlap model, and valence bond-based models. Quantum mechanical studies of metal ion-containing systems at the semiempirical, ab initio, and density functional levels of theory are reviewed as well with a particular focus on how these methods inform classical modeling efforts. Finally, conclusions and future prospects and directions are offered that will further enhance the classical modeling of metal ion-containing systems.

 The coupling between two atomically sharp nanocontacts provides tunable access to a fundamental underlying interaction: the formation of the bond between two atoms as they are brought into contact. Here we report a detailed experimental and theoretical analysis of the relation between the chemical force and the tunneling current during bond formation in atom-scale metallic junctions and their dependence on distance, junction structure, and material. We found that the short-range force as well as the conductance in two prototypical metal junctions depend exponentially on the distance and that they have essentially the same exponents. In the transition regime between tunneling and point contact, large short-range forces generate structural relaxations which are concomitant with modifications of the surface electronic structure and the collapse of the tunneling barrier. {\textcopyright} 2010 The American Physical Society.

@abstract:
 Historically, materials discovery has been driven by a laborious trial-and-error process. The growth of materials databases and emerging informatics approaches finally offer the opportunity to transform this practice into data- and knowledge-driven rational design. By using data from the AFLOW repository for high-throughput ab-initio calculations, we have generated Quantitative Materials Structure-Property Relationship (QMSPR) models to predict eight critical electronic and thermomechanical materials properties, such as the metal/insulator classification, band gap energy, bulk and shear moduli, Debye temperature, and heat capacity. The prediction accuracy obtained with these QMSPR models approaches training data for virtually any stoichiometric inorganic crystalline material. The success and universality of these models is attributed to the construction of new materials descriptors---referred to as the universal Property-Labeled Materials Fragments (PLMF). The representation requires only minimal structural input and affords straightforward model interpretation in terms of simple heuristic design rules that guide rational materials design. This study demonstrates the power of materials informatics to dramatically accelerate the search for new materials.

**Note:** The article presents a new methodology, Property-Labeled Materials Fragments (PLMF), for predicting electronic properties of inorganic crystals. This approach uses data from the AFLOW repository and generates Quantitative Materials Structure-Property Relationship (QMSPR) models with high prediction accuracy. The universality and success of these models are attributed to the construction of new materials descriptors that require minimal structural input and provide straightforward model interpretation in terms of simple heuristic design rules.

@abstract:
 According to Kirchhoff's circuit laws, the net conductance of two parallel components in an electronic circuit is the sum of the individual conductances. However, when the circuit dimensions are comparable to the electronic phase coherence length, quantum interference effects play a critical role, as exemplified by the Aharonova-Bohm effect in metal rings. At the molecular scale, interference effects dramatically reduce the electron transfer rate through a meta-connected benzene ring when compared with a para-connected benzene ring. For longer conjugated and cross-conjugated molecules, destructive interference effects have been observed in the tunnelling conductance through molecular junctions. Here, we investigate the conductance superposition law for parallel components in single-molecule circuits, particularly the role of interference. We synthesize a series of molecular systems that contain either one backbone or two backbones in parallel, bonded together cofacially by a common linker on each end. Single-molecule conductance measurements and transport calculations based on density functional theory show that the conductance of a double-backbone molecular junction can be more than twice that of a single-backbone junction, providing clear evidence for constructive interference.

Our model explicitly takes into account the charge densities of the sample and the probe for the calculation of the short-range (SR) interaction and retains ab initio accuracy with only two parameters, that are essentially universal, independent of the number of chemical species and the complexity of the bonding topology. The application to molecular images shows a strong dependence on the stoichiometry and bonding configuration that precludes the chemical identification of individual atoms based on local force--distance curves. However, we have identified features in the 2D images and 3D force maps that reflect the highly anisotropic spatial decay of the molecular charge density and provide a way towards molecular identification.

@abstract:
 The quantum measurement problem, to wit, understanding why a unique outcome is obtained in each individual experiment, is currently tackled by solving models. After an introduction we review the many dynamical models proposed over the years for elucidating quantum measurements. The approaches range from standard quantum theory, relying for instance on quantum statistical mechanics or on decoherence, to quantum-classical methods, to consistent histories and to modifications of the theory. Next, a flexible and rather realistic quantum model is introduced, describing the measurement of the z-component of a spin through interaction with a magnetic memory simulated by a Curie-Weiss magnet, including N ??? 1 spins weakly coupled to a phonon bath. Initially prepared in a metastable paramagnetic state, it may transit to its up or down ferromagnetic state, triggered by its coupling with the tested spin, so that its magnetization acts as a pointer. A detailed solution of the dynamical equations is worked out, exhibiting several time scales. Conditions on the parameters of the model are found, which ensure that the process satisfies all the features of ideal measurements. Various imperfections of the measurement are discussed, as well as attempts of incompatible measurements. The first steps consist in the solution of the Hamiltonian dynamics for the spin-apparatus density matrix over(D, ??) (t). Its off-diagonal blocks in a basis selected by the spin-pointer coupling, rapidly decay owing to the many degrees of freedom of the pointer. Recurrences are ruled out either by some randomness of that coupling, or by the interaction with the bath. On a longer time scale, the trend towards equilibrium of the magnet produces a final state over(D, ??) (tf) that involves correlations between the system and the indications of the pointer, thus ensuring registration. Although over(D, ??) (tf) has the form expected for ideal measurements, it only describes a large set of runs. Individual runs are approached by analyzing the final states associated with all possible subensembles of runs, within a specified version of the statistical interpretation. There the difficulty lies in a quantum ambiguity: There exist many incompatible decompositions of the density matrix over(D, ??) (tf) into a sum of sub-matrices, so that one cannot infer from its sole determination the states that would describe small subsets of runs. This difficulty is overcome by dynamics due to suitable interactions within the apparatus, which produce a special combination of relaxation and decoherence associated with the broken invariance of the pointer. Any subset of runs thus reaches over a brief delay a stable state which satisfies the same hierarchic property as in classical probability theory; the reduction of the state for each individual run follows. Standard quantum statistical mechanics alone appears sufficient to explain the occurrence of a unique answer in each run and the emergence of classicality in a measurement process. Finally, pedagogical exercises are proposed and lessons for future works on models are suggested, while the statistical interpretation is promoted for teaching. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.

 By suitably adapting a recent approach [A. Laio and M. Parrinello, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 99, 12 562 (2002)]] we develop a powerful molecular dynamics method for the study of pressure-induced structural transformations. We use the edges of the simulation cell as collective variables and define a metadynamics that drives the system away from the local minimum towards a new crystal structure. In contrast to the Parrinello-Rahman method, our approach shows no hysteresis, and crystal structure transformations can occur at the equilibrium pressure. We illustrate the power of the method by studying the pressure-induced diamond to simple hexagonal phase transition in a model of silicon.

@abstract:
 One of the dream reactions in polymer chemistry is the bottom-up, self-assembled synthesis of polymer fabrics, with interwoven, one-dimensional fibres of monomolecular thickness forming planar pieces of textiles. We have made a major step towards realizing this goal by assembling sophisticated, quadritopic linkers into surface-mounted metal-organic frameworks. By sandwiching these quadritopic linkers between sacrificial metal-organic framework thin films, we obtained multi-heteroepitaxial, crystalline systems. In a next step, Glaser-Hay coupling of triple bonds in the quadritopic linkers yields linear, interwoven polymer chains. X-ray diffraction studies revealed that this topochemical reaction leaves the MOF backbone completely intact. After removing the metal ions, the textile sheets can be transferred onto different supports and imaged using scanning electron microscopy and atomic-force microscopy. The individual polymer strands forming the two-dimensional textiles have lengths on the order of 200 nm, as evidenced by atomic-force microscopy images recorded from the disassembled textiles.

 We introduce a general and in a certain sense time-optimal way of solving one problem after another, efficiently searching the space of programs that compute solution candidates, including those programs that organize and manage and adapt and reuse earlier acquired knowledge. The Optimal Ordered Problem Solver (OOPS) draws inspiration from Levin's Universal Search designed for single problems and universal Turing machines. It spends part of the total search time for a new problem on testing programs that exploit previous solution-computing programs in computable ways. If the new problem can be solved faster by copy-editing/invoking previous code than by solving the new problem from scratch, then OOPS will find this out. If not, then at least the previous solutions will not cause much harm. We introduce an efficient, recursive, backtracking-based way of implementing OOPS on realistic computers with limited storage. Experiments illustrate how OOPS can greatly profit from metalearning or metasearching, that is, searching for faster search procedures.

In this work we characterize the chemical and electronic structure of individual chains of oligo-(E)-1,1'-bi(indenylidene), a polyacetylene derivative that we have obtained through cooperative C1-C5 thermal enediyne cyclizations on Au(111) surfaces followed by a step-growth polymerization of the (E)-1,1'-bi(indenylidene) diradical intermediates. We have determined the combined structural and electronic properties of this class of oligomers by characterizing the atomically precise chemical structure of individual monomer building blocks and oligomer chains (via noncontact atomic force microscopy (nc-AFM)), as well as by imaging their localized and extended molecular orbitals (via scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (STM/STS)). Our combined structural and electronic measurements reveal that the energy associated with extended $\pi$-conjugated states in these oligomers is significantly lower than the energy of the corresponding localized monomer orbitals, consistent with theoretical predictions.

@abstract:
 Photosynthetic processes, including light capture, electron transfer, and energy conversion, are not only ensured by the activities of individual photosynthetic complexes but also substantially determined and regulated by the composition and assembly of the overall photosynthetic apparatus at the supramolecular level. In recent years, atomic force microscopy (AFM) has matured as a unique and powerful tool for directly assessing the supramolecular assembly of integral membrane protein complexes in their native membrane environment at submolecular resolution. This review highlights the major contributions and advances of AFM studies to our understanding of the structure of the bacterial photosynthetic machinery and its regulatory arrangement during chromatic adaptation. AFM topographs of other biological membrane systems and potential future applications of AFM are also discussed.

@abstract:
 Defects are usually seen as imperfections in materials that could significantly degrade their performance. However, at the nanoscale, defects could be extremely useful since they could be exploited to generate novel, innovative and useful materials and devices. Graphene and graphene nanoribbons are no exception. This review therefore tries to categorize defects, emphasize their importance, introduce the common routes to study and identify them and to propose new ways to construct novel devices based on 'defective' graphene-like materials. In particular, we will discuss defects in graphene-like systems including (a) structural (sp(2)-like) defects, (b) topological (sp(2)-like) defects, (c) doping or functionalization (sp(2)- and sp(3)-like) defects and (d) vacancies/edge type defects (non-sp(2)-like). It will be demonstrated that defects play a key role in graphene physicochemical properties and could even be critical to generate biocompatible materials. There are numerous challenges in this emerging field, and we intend to provide a stimulating account which could trigger new science and technological developments based on defective graphene-like materials that could be introduced into other atomic layered materials, such as BN, MoS(2) and WS(2), not discussed in this review.

@abstract:
 The electrical resistance of wires consisting of either a single xenon atom or two xenon atoms in series was measured and calculated on the basis of an atom-jellium model. Both the measurement and the calculation yielded a resistance of 10(5) ohms for the single-xenon atom system and 10(7) ohms for the two-xenon atom system. These resistances greatly exceeded the 12,900-ohm resistance of an ideal one-dimensional conduction channel because conduction through the xenon atoms occurs through the tail of the xenon 6s resonance, which lies far above the Fermi level. This conduction process in an atom-sized system can now be understood in terms of the electronic states of individual atoms.

@abstract:
 Entanglement of excitons holds great promise for the future of quantum computing, which would use individual molecular dyes as building blocks of their circuitry. Even though entangled excitonic eigenstates emerging in coupled molecular assemblies can be detected by far-field spectroscopies, access to the individual modes in real space will bring the much needed insight into the photophysics of these fascinating quantum phenomena. Here we combine tip-enhanced spectromicroscopy with atomic force microscopy to inspect delocalized single-exciton states of charged molecular assemblies engineered from individual perylenetetracarboxylic dianhydride molecules. Hyperspectral mapping of the eigenstates and comparison with calculated many-body optical transitions reveals a second low-lying excited state of the anion monomers and its role in the exciton entanglement within the assemblies. We also demonstrate control over the coupling by switching the assembly charge states. Our results reveal the possibility of tailoring excitonic properties of organic dye aggregates for advanced functionalities and establish the methodology to address them individually at the nanoscale.

@abstract:
 Obtaining the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of large matrices is a key problem in electronic structure theory and many other areas of computational science. The computational effort formally scales as O(N(3)) with the size of the investigated problem, N (e.g. the electron count in electronic structure theory), and thus often defines the system size limit that practical calculations cannot overcome. In many cases, more than just a small fraction of the possible eigenvalue/eigenvector pairs is needed, so that iterative solution strategies that focus only on a few eigenvalues become ineffective. Likewise, it is not always desirable or practical to circumvent the eigenvalue solution entirely. We here review some current developments regarding dense eigenvalue solvers and then focus on the Eigenvalue soLvers for Petascale Applications (ELPA) library, which facilitates the efficient algebraic solution of symmetric and Hermitian eigenvalue problems for dense matrices that have real-valued and complex-valued matrix entries, respectively, on parallel computer platforms. ELPA addresses standard as well as generalized eigenvalue problems, relying on the well documented matrix layout of the Scalable Linear Algebra PACKage (ScaLAPACK) library but replacing all actual parallel solution steps with subroutines of its own. For these steps, ELPA significantly outperforms the corresponding ScaLAPACK routines and proprietary libraries that implement the ScaLAPACK interface (e.g. Intel's MKL). The most time-critical step is the reduction of the matrix to tridiagonal form and the corresponding backtransformation of the eigenvectors. ELPA offers both a one-step tridiagonalization (successive Householder transformations) and a two-step transformation that is more efficient especially towards larger matrices and larger numbers of CPU cores. ELPA is based on the MPI standard, with an early hybrid MPI-OpenMPI implementation available as well. Scalability beyond 10,000 CPU cores for problem sizes arising in the field of electronic structure theory is demonstrated for current high-performance computer architectures such as Cray or Intel/Infiniband. For a matrix of dimension 260,000, scalability up to 295,000 CPU cores has been shown on BlueGene/P.

@author:   Lochan, Rohini C. and Jung, Yousung and Head-Gordon, Martin
@doi:      10.1021/jp0514426
@abstract:
 Separate scaling of the same-spin and opposite spin contributions to the second-order M{\o}ller-Plesset energy can yield statistically improved performance for a variety of chemical problems. If only the opposite spin contribution is scaled, it is also possible to reduce the computational complexity from fifth order to fourth order in system size, with very little degradation of the results. However neither of these scaled MP2 energies recovers the full MP2 result for the dispersion energy of nonoverlapping systems. This deficiency is addressed in this work by using a distance-dependent scaling of the opposite spin correlation energy. The resulting method is compared against the previously proposed scaled MP2 methods on a range of problems involving both short and long-range interactions. {\textcopyright} 2005 American Chemical Society.

@abstract:
 Highly unsaturated I -rich carbon skeletons afford versatile tuning of structural and optoelectronic properties of low-dimensional carbon nanostructures. However, methods allowing more precise chemical identification and controllable integration of target sp-/sp2-carbon skeletons during synthesis are required. Here, using the coupling of terminal alkynes as a model system, we demonstrate a methodology to visualize and identify the generated I -skeletons at the single-chemical-bond level on the surface, thus enabling further precise bond control. The characteristic electronic features together with localized vibrational modes of the carbon skeletons are resolved in real space by a combination of scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS) and tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS). Our approach allows single-chemical-bond understanding of unsaturated carbon skeletons, which is crucial for generating low-dimensional carbon nanostructures and nanomaterials with atomic precision.

 In electronic structure calculations, various material properties can be obtained by means of computing the total energy of a system as well as derivatives of the total energy w.r.t. atomic positions. The derivatives, also known as Hellman–Feynman forces, require, because of practical computational reasons, the discretized charge density and wave functions having continuous second derivatives in the whole solution domain. We describe an application of isogeometric analysis (IGA), a spline modification of finite element method (FEM), to achieve the required continuity. The novelty of our approach is in employing the technique of B{\'{e}}zier extraction to add the IGA capabilities to our FEM based code for ab initio calculations of electronic states of non-periodic systems within the density-functional framework, built upon the open source finite element package SfePy. We compare FEM and IGA in benchmark problems and several numerical results are presented.

@abstract:
 Studying DNA hybridization equilibrium at atomistic length scales, either via molecular dynamics (MD) or through commonly used advanced sampling approaches, is notoriously difficult. In this work, we describe an order-parameter-based advanced sampling technique to calculate the free energy of hybridization, and estimate the melting temperature of DNA oligomers at atomistic resolution. The free energy landscapes are reported as a function of a native-topology-based order parameter for the Drew-Dickerson dodecamer and for a range of DNA decamer sequences of different GC content. Our estimated melting temperatures match the experimental numbers within ±15 °C. As a test of the numerical reliability of the procedures employed, it was verified that the predicted free energy surfaces and melting temperatures of the d- A nd l-enantiomers of the Drew-Dickerson dodecamer were indistinguishable within numerical accuracy.

@abstract:
 We apply our recently developed metadynamics method to the docking of ligands on flexible receptors in water solution. This method mimics the real dynamics of a ligand exiting or entering an enzyme and in so doing reconstructs the free energy surface. We apply it to four docking cases: beta-trypsin/benzamidine, beta-trypsin/chlorobenzamidine, immunoglobulin McPC-603/phosphocholine, and cyclin-dependent kinase 2/staurosporine. In every case studied, the method is able to predict the docked geometry and the free energy of docking. Its added value with respect to many other available methods is that it reconstructs the complete free energy surface, including all the relevant minima and the barriers between them.

@abstract:
 In this work, a fragment-orbital density functional theory-based method is combined with two different non-adiabatic schemes for the propagation of the electronic degrees of freedom. This allows us to perform unbiased simulations of electron transfer processes in complex media, and the computational scheme is applied to the transfer of a hole in solvated DNA. It turns out that the mean-field approach, where the wave function of the hole is driven into a superposition of adiabatic states, leads to over-delocalization of the hole charge. This problem is avoided using a surface hopping scheme, resulting in a smaller rate of hole transfer. The method is highly efficient due to the on-the-fly computation of the coarse-grained DFT Hamiltonian for the nucleobases, which is coupled to the environment using a QM/MM approach. The computational efficiency and partial parallel character of the methodology make it possible to simulate electron transfer in systems of relevant biochemical size on a nanosecond time scale. Since standard non-polarizable force fields are applied in the molecular-mechanics part of the calculation, a simple scaling scheme was introduced into the electrostatic potential in order to simulate the effect of electronic polarization. It is shown that electronic polarization has an important effect on the features of charge transfer. The methodology is applied to two kinds of DNA sequences, illustrating the features of transfer along a flat energy landscape as well as over an energy barrier. The performance and relative merit of the mean-field scheme and the surface hopping for this application are discussed.

@author:   Lochan, Rohini C. and Shao, Yihan and Head-Gordon, Martin
@doi:      10.1021/ct600292h
@abstract:
 The analytical gradient of the "scaled opposite spin" (SOS-) and "modified opposite spin" (MOS-) second-order M{\o}ller-Plesset perturbation theory (MP2) methods is derived and implemented. Both energy and the first derivative can be evaluated efficiently with a fourth-order scaling algorithm by using a combination of auxiliary basis expansions and Laplace transformation techniques as opposed to the traditional fifth-order approach of MP2. A statistical analysis of 178 small molecules suggests that the new gradient scheme provides geometries of MP2 quality, indicating the reliability of the method in general chemical applications. A more specific study of the group VI transition metal carbonyl complexes indicates that the new scheme improves the MP2 description relative to available experimental data and higher-order theories. The proposed gradient scheme thus endeavors to obtain improved structural features at reduced computational cost. {\textcopyright} 2007 American Chemical Society.

@abstract:
 Silicon quantum dots (SiQDs) hold great promise for many future technologies. Silicon is already at the core of photovoltaics and microelectronics, and SiQDs are capable of efficient light emission and amplification. This is crucial for the development of the next technological frontiers-silicon photonics and optoelectronics. Unlike any other quantum dots (QDs), SiQDs are made of non-toxic and abundant material, offering one of the spectrally broadest emission tunabilities accessible with semiconductor QDs and allowing for tailored radiative rates over many orders of magnitude. This extraordinary flexibility of optical properties is achieved via a combination of the spatial confinement of carriers and the strong influence of surface chemistry. The complex physics of this material, which is still being unraveled, leads to new effects, opening up new opportunities for applications. In this review we summarize the latest progress in this fascinating research field, with special attention given to surface-induced effects, such as the emergence of direct bandgap transitions, and collective effects in densely packed QDs, such as space separated quantum cutting.

 Irradiating solids with energetic particles is usually thought to introduce disorder, normally an undesirable phenomenon. But recent experiments on electron or ion irradiation of various nanostructures demonstrate that it can have beneficial effects and that electron or ion beams may be used to tailor the structure and properties of nanosystems with high precision. Moreover, in many cases irradiation can lead to self-organization or self-assembly in nanostructures. In this review we survey recent advances in the rapidly evolving area of irradiation effects in nanostructured materials, with particular emphasis on carbon systems because of their technological importance and the unique ability of graphitic networks to reconstruct under irradiation. We dwell not only on the physics behind irradiation of nanostructures but also on the technical applicability of irradiation for nanoengineering of carbon and other systems.

@abstract:
 We present an accurate machine learning (ML) model for atomistic simulations of carbon, constructed using the Gaussian approximation potential (GAP) methodology. The potential, named GAP-20, describes the properties of the bulk crystalline and amorphous phases, crystal surfaces, and defect structures with an accuracy approaching that of direct ab initio simulation, but at a significantly reduced cost. We combine structural databases for amorphous carbon and graphene, which we extend substantially by adding suitable configurations, for example, for defects in graphene and other nanostructures. The final potential is fitted to reference data computed using the optB88-vdW density functional theory (DFT) functional. Dispersion interactions, which are crucial to describe multilayer carbonaceous materials, are therefore implicitly included. We additionally account for long-range dispersion interactions using a semianalytical two-body term and show that an improved model can be obtained through an optimization of the many-body smooth overlap of atomic positions descriptor. We rigorously test the potential on lattice parameters, bond lengths, formation energies, and phonon dispersions of numerous carbon allotropes. We compare the formation energies of an extensive set of defect structures, surfaces, and surface reconstructions to DFT reference calculations. The present work demonstrates the ability to combine, in the same ML model, the previously attained flexibility required for amorphous carbon [V. L. Deringer and G. Cs{\'{a}}nyi, Phys. Rev. B 95, 094203 (2017)] with the high numerical accuracy necessary for crystalline graphene [Rowe et al., Phys. Rev.

@abstract:
 In spite of the unprecedented resolution provided by non-contact atomic force microscopy (AFM) with CO-functionalized and advances in the interpretation of the observed contrast, the unambiguous identification of molecular systems solely based on AFM images, without any prior information, remains an open problem. This work presents a first step towards the automatic classification of AFM experimental images by a deep learning model trained essentially with a theoretically generated dataset. We analyze the limitations of two standard models for pattern recognition when applied to AFM image classification and develop a model with the optimal depth to provide accurate results and to retain the ability to generalize. We show that a variational autoencoder (VAE) provides a very efficient way to incorporate, from very few experimental images, characteristic features into the training set that assure a high accuracy in the classification of both theoretical and experimental images.

@abstract:
 Nanometer materials have been attracting strong attention due to their interesting structure and properties. Many important practical applications have been demonstrated for nanometer materials based on their unique properties. This article provides a review on the fabrication, electrical characterization, and memory application of two-terminal resistive-switching devices using nanomaterials as the active components, including metal and semiconductor nanoparticles (NPs), nanotubes, nanowires, and graphenes. There are mainly two types of device architectures for the two-terminal devices with NPs. One has a triple-layer structure with a metal film sandwiched between two organic semiconductor layers, and the other has a single polymer film blended with NPs. These devices can be electrically switched between two states with significant different resistances, i.e. the 'ON' and 'OFF' states. These render the devices important application as two-terminal non-volatile memory devices. The electrical behavior of these devices can be affected by the materials in the active layer and the electrodes. Though the mechanism for the electrical switches has been in argument, it is generally believed that the resistive switches are related to charge storage on the NPs. Resistive switches were also observed on crossbars formed by nanotubes, nanowires, and graphene ribbons. The resistive switches are due to nanoelectromechanical behavior of the materials. The Coulombic interaction of transient charges on the nanomaterials affects the configurable gap of the crossbars, which results into significant change in current through the crossbars. These nanoelectromechanical devices can be used as fast-response and high-density memory devices as well.

@abstract:
 Evaluating the (dis)similarity of crystalline, disordered and molecular compounds is a critical step in the development of algorithms to navigate automatically the configuration space of complex materials. For instance, a structural similarity metric is crucial for classifying structures, searching chemical space for better compounds and materials, and to drive the next generation of machine-learning techniques for predicting the stability and properties of molecules and materials. In the last few years several strategies have been designed to compare atomic coordination environments. In particular, the Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions (SOAP) has emerged as a natural framework to obtain translation, rotation and permutation-invariant descriptors of groups of atoms, driven by the design of various classes of machine-learned inter-atomic potentials. Here we discuss how one can combine such local descriptors using a Regularized Entropy Match (REMatch) approach to describe the similarity of both whole molecular and bulk periodic structures, introducing powerful metrics that allow the navigation of alchemical and structural complexity within a unified framework. Furthermore, using this kernel and a ridge regression method we can also predict atomization energies for a database of small organic molecules with a mean absolute error below 1 kcal/mol, reaching an important milestone in the application of machine-learning techniques to the evaluation of molecular properties.

 The space-fixed genetic algorithm originally proposed by Niesse and Mayne [J. Chem. Phys. 105, 4700 (1996)] is modified and used to study the lowest energy structure of small silicon clusters by employing empirical interat. potentials. In this new space-fixed genetic algorithm, a gradient-free simplex method, rather than the conventional gradient-driven conjugate gradient minimization employed by Niesse and Mayne, is selected by virtue of its flexibility and applicability to any form of interat. potentials for which the calcn. of derivs. is difficult. Using two empirical three-body potentials, we calcd. the ground state structure up to Si15 successfully using this new genetic algorithm based on the simplex method. The effect of angular dependent three-body potentials on the cluster structures is examd. and compared with the exptl. results.

. Characterization of cyclo[18]carbon by high-resolution atomic force microscopy revealed a polyynic structure with defined positions of alternating triple and single bonds. The high reactivity of cyclocarbon and cyclocarbon oxides allows covalent coupling between molecules to be induced by atom manipulation, opening an avenue for the synthesis of other carbon allotropes and carbon-rich materials from the coalescence of cyclocarbon molecules.

@abstract:
 A current objective in supramolecular chemistry is to mimic the transitions between complex self‐sorted systems that represent a hallmark of regulatory function in nature. In this work, a self‐sorting network, comprising linear hydrogen motifs, was created. Selecting six hydrogen‐bonding motifs capable of both high‐fidelity and promiscuous molecular recognition gave rise to a complex self‐sorting system, which included motifs capable of both narcissistic and social self‐sorting. Examination of the interactions between individual components, experimentally and computationally, provided a rationale for the product distribution during each phase of a cascade. This reasoning holds through up to five sequential additions of six building blocks, resulting in the construction of a biomimetic network in which the presence or absence of different components provides multiple unique pathways to distinct self‐sorted configurations.

@abstract:
 Continuing population and consumption growth will mean that the global demand for food will increase for at least another 40 years. Growing competition for land, water, and energy, in addition to the overexploitation of fisheries, will affect our ability to produce food, as will the urgent requirement to reduce the impact of the food system on the environment. The effects of climate change are a further threat. But the world can produce more food and can ensure that it is used more efficiently and equitably. A multifaceted and linked global strategy is needed to ensure sustainable and equitable food security, different components of which are explored here.

@abstract:
 In practical applications, global cluster structure optimisation has so far been limited largely to homogeneous clusters of atoms or small molecules, with little or no choice in the calculation of inter-particle forces. We eliminate these limitations by presenting a new program suite OGOLEM that is universal by design, both in cluster composition (including arbitrarily heterogeneous clusters of complicated molecules) and in its interfaces to force calculation backends. This is demonstrated by exemplary applications in two novel fields: strongly heterogeneous Lennard-Jones clusters (ternary, quaternary, quinary) and mixed clusters of the aminoglycoside Kanamycin A with sodium cations.

 The behavior of halide salts at the vapor/water interface has been the focus of a tremendous amount of work in the past ten years. A molecular view of the interface has been introduced with the observation that large anions have some affinity for the interface, but a quantitative description of the driving forces that determine ion adsorption or repulsion at the interface is still missing. This review discusses recent developments that are based on classical and quantum-chemical molecular simulations as well as developments that are based on simple potential models.

@abstract:
 Hybrid systems consisting of organic molecules at inorganic semiconductor surfaces are gaining increasing importance as thin film devices for optoelectronics. The efficiency of such devices strongly depends on the collective behavior of the adsorbed molecules. In the present paper, we propose a novel, coarse-grained model addressing the condensed phases of a representative hybrid system, that is, para-sexiphenyl (6P) at zinc-oxide (ZnO). Within our model, intermolecular interactions are represented via a Gay-Berne potential (describing steric and van-der-Waals interactions) combined with the electrostatic potential between two linear quadrupoles. Similarly, the molecule-substrate interactions include a coupling between a linear molecular quadrupole to the electric field generated by the line charges characterizing ZnO(10-10). To validate our approach, we perform equilibrium Monte Carlo simulations, where the lateral positions are fixed to a 2D lattice, while the rotational degrees of freedom are continuous. We use these simulations to investigate orientational ordering in the condensed state. We reproduce various experimentally observed features such as the alignment of individual molecules with the line charges on the surface, the formation of a standing uniaxial phase with a herringbone structure, as well as the formation of a lying nematic phase.

@abstract:
 Modern chemistry seems to be unlimited in molecular size and elemental composition. Metal-organic frameworks or biological macromolecules involve complex architectures and a large variety of elements. Yet, a general and broadly applicable theoretical method to describe the structures and interactions of molecules beyond the 1000-atom size regime semi-quantitatively is not self-evident. For this purpose, a generic force field named GFN-FF is presented, which is completely newly developed to enable fast structure optimizations and molecular-dynamics simulations for basically any chemical structure consisting of elements up to radon. The freely available computer program requires only starting coordinates and elemental composition as input from which, fully automatically, all potential-energy terms are constructed. GFN-FF outperforms other force fields in terms of generality and accuracy, approaching the performance of much more elaborate quantum-mechanical methods in many cases.

 In this paper, we calculate energy required to copy one bit of useful information in the presence of thermal noise. For this purpose, we consider a quantum system capable of storing one bit of classical information, which is initially in a mixed state corresponding to temperature T. We calculate how many of these systems must be used to store useful information and control bits protecting the content against transmission errors. Finally, we analyze how adding these extra bits changes the total energy consumed during the copying.

@abstract:
 The description of hydrogen bonds in the density-functional tight-binding (DFTB) method continues to be a challenging task because the approximations that make the method computationally efficient compromise already the first-order electrostatic contribution to the interaction. So far, the best results have been achieved with fully empirical corrections such as the recently reparametrized DFTB3-D3H4 method. This approach has, however, important limitations that arise from its independence of the actual electronic structure. Here, we present a novel correction denoted as D3H5, which is integrated deeper in the DFTB method, correcting the problem at the place of its origin. It is applied within the self-consistent evaluation of electrostatic interactions, where it empirically models the missing contributions of atomic multipoles and polarization. Despite being very simple and using fewer parameters than D3H4, it is both more accurate and more robust. In data sets of small model systems, it yields errors below 1 kcal/mol, and it performs comparably well in larger systems. Unlike D3H4, it can describe cooperativity in H-bond networks, which makes it more transferable to more complex systems.

@abstract:
 {\textless}p{\textgreater}A simple modification of second-order M{\o}ller–Plesset perturbation theory (MP2) to improve the description of molecular ground state energies is proposed. The total MP2 correlation energy is partitioned into parallel- and antiparallel-spin components which are separately scaled. The two parameters (scaling factors), whose values can be justified by basic theoretical arguments, have been optimized on a benchmark set of 51 reaction energies composed of 74 first-row molecules. It is found, that the new method performs significantly better than standard MP2: the rms [mean absolute error (MAE)] deviation drops from 4.6 (3.3) to 2.3 (1.8) kcal/mol. The maximum error is reduced from 13.3 to 5.1 kcal/mol. Significant improvements are especially observed for cases which are usually known as MP2 pitfalls while cases already described well with MP2 remain almost unchanged. Even for 11 atomization energies not considered in the fit, uniform improvements [MAE: 8.1 kcal/mol (MP2) versus 3.2 kcal/mol (new)] are found. The results are furthermore compared with those from density functional theory (DFT/B3LYP) and quadratic configuration interaction [QCISD/QCISD(T)] calculations. Also for difficult systems including strong (nondynamical) correlation effects, the improved MP2 method clearly outperforms DFT/B3LYP and yields results of QCISD or sometimes QCISD(T) quality. Preliminary calculations of the equilibrium bond lengths and harmonic vibrational frequencies for ten diatomic molecules also show consistent enhancements. The uniformity with which the new method improves upon MP2, thereby rectifying many of its problems, indicates significant robustness and suggests it as a valuable quantum chemical method of general use.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}

 During recent years, the theory of charged particle optics together with advances in fabrication tolerances and experimental techniques has lead to very significant advances in high-performance electron microscopes. Here, we will describe which theoretical tools, inventions and designs have driven this development. We cover the basic theory of higher-order electron optics and of image formation in electron microscopes. This leads to a description of different methods to correct aberrations by multipole fields and to a discussion of the most advanced design that take advantage of these techniques. The theory of electron mirrors is developed and it is shown how this can be used to correct aberrations and to design energy filters. Finally, different types of energy filters are described.

@abstract:
 The single-crystal-to-single-crystal (SCSC) transformation is a fascinating and valuable outcome of topochemical reactions. Not like the solution-state reactions, the movement and transformation of the molecule in single-crystal state is such a mysterious and attractive research topic. The molecular packing of the monomers prior to the reaction could provide many possibilities for the formation of complicated topological structures. The further reaction or polymerization in the single crystal state could realize the preparation of covalent complicated topological structures. In this review, we summarized six different types of organic reactions that could realize the SCSC conversion, namely [2 + 2], [4 + 4], and [4 + 2] photo-cycloaddition, dienes polymerization, acetylenes polymerization and topochemical azide-alkyne cycloaddition. The crystalline packing phases offer the possibility of significant advances in the crystal structure design. Some examples of 1D or 2D polymer single crystals realized by SCSC transformation were summarized subsequently.

@abstract:
 Graphene is one of the most promising materials in nanotechnology. The electronic and mechanical properties of graphene samples with high perfection of the atomic lattice are outstanding, but structural defects, which may appear during growth or processing, deteriorate the performance of graphene-based devices. However, deviations from perfection can be useful in some applications, as they make it possible to tailor the local properties of graphene and to achieve new functionalities. In this article, the present knowledge about point and line defects in graphene are reviewed. Particular emphasis is put on the unique ability of graphene to reconstruct its lattice around intrinsic defects, leading to interesting effects and potential applications. Extrinsic defects such as foreign atoms which are of equally high importance for designing graphene-based devices with dedicated properties are also discussed.

@abstract:
 Oxygen binding and cleavage are important for both molecular recognition and catalysis. Mn-based porphyrins in particular are used as catalysts for the epoxidation of alkenes, and in this study the homolytic cleavage of O2 by a surface-supported monolayer of Mn porphyrins on Ag(111) is demonstrated by scanning tunneling microscopy, X-ray absorption, and X-ray photoemission. As deposited, {\{}5,10,15,20-tetraphenylporphyrinato{\}}Mn(III)Cl (MnClTPP) adopts a saddle conformation with the average plane of its macrocycle parallel to the substrate and the axial Cl ligand pointing upward, away from the substrate. The adsorption of MnClTPP on Ag(111) is accompanied by a reduction of the Mn oxidation state from Mn(III) to Mn(II) due to charge transfer between the substrate and the molecule. Annealing the Mn(II)ClTPP monolayer up to 510 K causes the chlorine ligands to desorb from the porphyrins while leaving the monolayer intact. The Mn(II)TPP is stabilized by the surface acting as an axial ligand for the metal center. Exposure of the Mn(II)TPP/Ag(111) system to molecular oxygen results in the dissociation of O2 and forms pairs of Mn(III)OTPP molecules on the surface. Annealing at 445 K reduces the Mn(III)OTPP complex back to Mn(II)TPP/Ag(111). The activation energies for Cl and O removal were found to be 0.35 ± 0.02 eV and 0.26 ± 0.03 eV, respectively.

@abstract:
 Cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) systems with rotational gantries that have standard flat panel detectors (FPD) are widely used for the 3D rendering of vascular structures using Feldkamp cone beam reconstruction algorithms. One of the inherent limitations of these systems is limited resolution ({\textless}3 lp/mm). There are systems available with higher resolution but their small FOV limits them to small animal imaging only. In this work, we report on region-of-interest (ROI) CBCT with a high resolution CMOS detector (75 $\mu$m pixels, 600 $\mu$m HR-CsI) mounted with motorized detector changer on a commercial FPD-based C-arm angiography gantry (194 $\mu$m pixels, 600 $\mu$m HL-CsI). A cylindrical CT phantom and neuro stents were imaged with both detectors. For each detector a total of 209 images were acquired in a rotational protocol. The technique parameters chosen for the FPD by the imaging system were used for the CMOS detector. The anti-scatter grid was removed and the incident scatter was kept the same for both detectors with identical collimator settings. The FPD images were reconstructed for the 10 cm x10 cm FOV and the CMOS images were reconstructed for a 3.84 cm × 3.84 cm FOV. Although the reconstructed images from the CMOS detector demonstrated comparable contrast to the FPD images, the reconstructed 3D images of the neuro stent clearly showed that the CMOS detector improved delineation of smaller objects such as the stent struts ({\~{}}70 $\mu$m) compared to the FPD. Further development and the potential for substantial clinical impact are suggested.

@abstract:
 A new and powerful analytical method for comparing molecular shapes by optimizing the overlap of molecular volumes has been developed. This shape comparison method provides both a quantitative measure of the shape similarity of molecules and a means to align molecules such that shape similarity if maximized. Our MSC method has been enhanced with an option to allow discrimination between groups with different chemical properties. Atoms or groups of atoms may be assigned to different classes based on specific properties such as electrostatic potential, hydrogen bonding ability, or hydrophobicity. This enables matches based on criteria such as alignment of hydrophobic groups or hydrogen bond acceptor groups. In this study, we report shape comparisons of angiotensin II (AII) receptor antagonists from two structural classes, 4-(biphenyl-4-ylmethoxy)-quinoline derivatives such as ICI D8731 and N-(biphenyl-4-ylmethyl)imidazole derivatives, such as DuP 753. Starting with a list of low-energy conformations for the two molecules, each conformation of the first molecule is paired with each of the conformations of the second molecule. For each of these conformational pairs, an MSC comparison, which generates multiple MSC maxima, is initiated. Eight high scoring conformational pairings were found with shape matching based on the intersection of the total molecular volume, while nine high-scoring pairs were identified with matching by atom type. MSC identifies conformational pairs with high shape similarity, as measured by the intersection volume, and thus generates and prioritizes several alternative models for the AII antagonist pharmacophore. {\textcopyright} 1993, American Chemical Society.

@author:   Keeter, Matthew J.
@doi:      10.1145/3386569.3392429
@abstract:
 We present a new method for directly rendering complex closed-form implicit surfaces on modern GPUs, taking advantage of their massive parallelism. Our model representation is unambiguously solid, can be sampled at arbitrary resolution, and supports both constructive solid geometry (CSG) and more unusual modeling operations (e.g. smooth blending of shapes). The rendering strategy scales to large-scale models with thousands of arithmetic operations in their underlying mathematical expressions. Our method only requires C0 continuity, allowing for warping and blending operations which break Lipshitz continuity. To render a model, its underlying expression is evaluated in a shallow hierarchy of spatial regions, using a high branching factor for efficient parallelization. Interval arithmetic is used to both skip empty regions and construct reduced versions of the expression. The latter is the optimization that makes our algorithm practical: in one benchmark, expression complexity decreases by two orders of magnitude between the original and reduced expressions. Similar algorithms exist in the literature, but tend to be deeply recursive with heterogeneous workloads in each branch, which makes them GPU-unfriendly; our evaluation and expression reduction both run efficiently as massively parallel algorithms, entirely on the GPU. The resulting system renders complex implicit surfaces in high resolution and at interactive speeds. We examine how performance scales with computing power, presenting performance results on hardware ranging from older laptops to modern data-center GPUs, and showing significant improvements at each stage.

@abstract:
 It has been found that a model of extended electrons is more suited to describe theoretical simulations and experimental results obtained via scanning tunnelling microscopes, but while the dynamic properties are easily incorporated, magnetic properties, and in particular electron spin properties pose a problem due to their conceived isotropy in the absence of measurement. The spin of an electron reacts with a magnetic field and thus has the properties of a vector. However, electron spin is also isotropic, suggesting that it does not have the properties of a vector. This central conflict in the description of an electron's spin, we believe, is the root of many of the paradoxical properties measured and postulated for quantum spin particles. Exploiting a model in which the electron spin is described consistently in real three-dimensional space - an extended electron model - we demonstrate that spin may be described by a vector and still maintain its isotropy. In this framework, we re-evaluate the Stern-Gerlach experiments, the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen experiments, and the effect of consecutive measurements and find in all cases a fairly intuitive explanation.

 The electromechanical properties of a single molecule covalently attached to two gold electrodes are studied by simultaneously measuring the conductance and the force during the stretching of the molecule. The conductance, the spring constant of the molecular junction, and the dependence of the conductance on the stretching force are determined. Like the conductance, the spring constant of a molecule depends also on the molecule-electrode contacts. The forces required to break the molecule-gold contacts are 1.5 nN for alkanedithiols and 0.8 nN for 4,4' bipyridine, indicating that the breakdowns take place at the Au-Au bond and at the N-Au bond, respectively.

@abstract:
 This brief paper continues a development in earlier publications by Rosenbrock, in which results in quantum mechanics were obtained by adding a random disturbance to Hamilton's principle. The disturbance is complex, and the resulting variational problem is solved by dynamic programming, which computes the causal relations needed to accomplish a purpose. It is shown here that this procedure leads to many results that agree with those obtained in the standard theory of quantum mechanics, but also to some that are not readily obtained in that theory. For example, certain changes at a time tm to the end condition xf, which will be reached at tftm, can instantaneously change some aspects of the particle's behaviour at t m while it is still in transit. This accounts for Einstein's 'spooky action at a distance'. An approach is also given to interference and entanglement, which is simpler than the standard account and may therefore be useful in quantum control and quantum computation. {\textcopyright} 2008 The Institute of Measurement and Control.

@abstract:
 We propose an efficient Monte Carlo method for the computation of the volumes of high-dimensional bodies with arbitrary shape. We start with a region of known volume within the interior of the manifold and then use the multi-state Bennett acceptance-ratio method to compute the dimensionless free-energy difference between a series of equilibrium simulations performed within this object. The method produces results that are in excellent agreement with thermodynamic integration, as well as a direct estimate of the associated statistical uncertainties. The histogram method also allows us to directly obtain an estimate of the interior radial probability density profile, thus yielding useful insight into the structural properties of such a high dimensional body. We illustrate the method by analysing the effect of structural disorder on the basins of attraction of mechanically stable packings of soft repulsive spheres.

@abstract:
 BACKGROUND: Patterns of care for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) strongly depend on the availability of on-site cardiac catheterization facilities. Although the management found at hospitals without on-site catheterization does not lead to increased mortality, little it known about its impact on resource utilization and non-fatal outcomes., METHODS: We identified all patients (n = 35,289) admitted with a first AMI in the province of Quebec between January 1, 1996 and March 31, 1999 using population-based administrative databases. Medical resource utilization and non-fatal and fatal outcomes were compared among patients admitted to hospitals with and without on-site cardiac catheterization facilities., RESULTS: Cardiac catheterization and PCI were more frequently performed among patients admitted to hospitals with catheterization facilities. However, non-invasive procedures were not used more frequently at hospitals without catheterization facilities. To the contrary, echocardiography [odds ratio (OR), 2.04; 95{\%} confidence interval (CI), 1.93-2.16] and multi-gated acquisition imaging (OR, 1.24; 95{\%} CI, 1.17-1.32) were used more frequently at hospitals with catheterization, and exercise treadmill testing (OR, 1.02; 95{\%} CI, 0.91-1.15) and Sestamibi/Thallium imaging (OR, 0.93; 95{\%} CI, 0.88-0.98) were used similarly at hospitals with and without catheterization. Use of anti-ischemic medications and frequency of emergency room and physician visits, were similar at both types of institutions. Readmission rates for AMI-related cardiac complications and mortality were also similar [adjusted hazard ratio, recurrent AMI: 1.02, 95{\%} CI, 0.89-1.16; congestive heart failure: 1.02; 95{\%} CI, 0.90-1.15; unstable angina: 0.93; 95{\%} CI, 0.85-1.02; mortality: 0.99; 95{\%} CI, 0.93-1.05)]., CONCLUSION: Although on-site availability of cardiac catheterization facilities is associated with greater use of invasive cardiac procedures, non-availability of catheterization did not translate into a higher use of non-invasive tests or have an impact on the fatal and non-fatal outcomes available for study in our administrative database.

@abstract:
 Spider capture silk is a natural material that outperforms almost any synthetic material in its combination of strength and elasticity. The structure of this remarkable material is still largely unknown, because spider-silk proteins have not been crystallized. Capture silk is the sticky spiral in the webs of orb-weaving spiders. Here we are investigating specifically the capture spiral threads from Araneus, an ecribellate orb-weaving spider. The major protein of these threads is flagelliform protein, a variety of silk fibroin. We present models for molecular and supramolecular structures of flagelliform protein, derived from amino acid sequences, force spectroscopy (molecular pulling) and stretching of bulk capture web. Pulling on molecules in capture-silk fibres from Araneus has revealed rupture peaks due to sacrificial bonds, characteristic of other self-healing biomaterials. The overall force changes are exponential for both capture-silk molecules and intact strands of capture silk.

@abstract:
 We show, using ab initio calculations based on density functional theory, that for hydrogen-passivated Si nanowires (SiNWs), the relative contribution of surface atoms to the band-edge states varies according to the way these surface atoms are bonded to the core ones. The largest influence occurs when these bonds are oriented along the wire's growth direction, which occurs either on the symmetric (001) 1 x 1 or the monohydrated (111) 1 x 1 surfaces. These results are obtained for wires grown along the [110] direction, with hexagonal cross-sections and facets corresponding to (111) and (001) planes, as observed experimentally. Their diameters range from about 10 to 35 A. On the basis of our results, we propose that particular facets should be more appropriate to be functionalized in order to build SiNW-based sensors. As an example, we have investigated the effect of NH2 adsorbed on some of these surfaces on the electronic structure of these wires.

 Petroleum is one of the most precious and complex molecular mixtures existing. Because of its chemical complexity, the solid component of crude oil, the asphaltenes, pose an exceptional challenge for structure analysis, with tremendous economic relevance. Here, we combine atomic resolution imaging using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and molecular orbital imaging using scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) to study more than one hundred asphaltene molecules. The complexity and range of asphaltene polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are established in detail. Identifying molecular structures provide a foundation to understand all aspects of petroleum science from colloidal structure and interfacial interactions to petroleum thermodynamics, enabling a first-principles approach to optimize resource utilization. Particularly, the findings contribute to a long-standing debate about asphaltene molecular architecture. Our technique constitutes a paradigm shift for the analysis of complex molecular mixtures, with possible applications in molecular electronics, organic light emitting diodes and photovoltaic devices.

 The binding energy and electronic coupling of perylenediimide (PDI) pi-stacked dimers were calculated using M06-2X/6-31++G** as a function of stacking geometry. Due to shallow minima in the potential energy surface, electronic coupling can vary by over an order of magnitude among, energetically accessible geometries. The coupling was then determined for 20 PDI derivatives with various substitutions at the imide region, and several were identified as the most promising candidates for organic thin film transistors (OTFTs). This strategy of side-by-side comparison of binding energy and electronic coupling may prove useful for other pi-stacked OTFTs such as pentacene and poly(thiophene) derivatives.

@abstract:
 With numerous new quantum chemistry methods being developed in recent years and the promise of even more new methods to be developed in the near future, it is clearly critical that highly accurate, well-balanced, reference data for many different atomic and molecular properties be available for the parametrization and validation of these methods. One area of research that is of particular importance in many areas of chemistry, biology, and material science is the study of noncovalent interactions. Because these interactions are often strongly influenced by correlati n effects, it is necessary to use computationally expensive high-order wave function methods to describe them accurately. Here, we present a large new database of interaction energies calculated using an accurate CCSD(T)/CBS scheme. Data are presented for 66 molecular complexes, at their reference equilibrium geometries and at 8 points systematically exploring their dissociation curves; in total, the database contains 594 points: 66 at equilibrium geometries, and 528 in dissociation curves. The data set is designed to cover the most common types of noncovalent interactions in biomolecules, while keeping a balanced representation of dispersion and electrostatic contributions. The data set is therefore well suited for testing and development of methods applicable to bioorganic systems. In addition to the benchmark CCSD(T) results, we also provide decompositions of the interaction energies by means of DFT-SAPT calculations.

@abstract:
 A redundant internal coordinate system for optimizing molecular geometries is constructed from all bonds, all valence angles between bonded atoms, and all dihedral angles between bonded atoms. Redundancies are removed by using the generalized inverse of the G matrix; constraints can be added by using an appropriate projector. For minimizations, redundant internal coordinates provide substantial improvements in optimization efficiency over Cartesian and nonredundant internal coordinates, especially for flexible and polycyclic systems. Transition structure searches are also improved when redundant coordinates are used and when the initial steps are guided by the quadratic synchronous transit approach.

@abstract:
 Scanning probe microscopy (SPM) has been extensively applied to probe interfacial water in many interdisciplinary fields but the disturbance of the probes on the hydrogen-bonding structure of water has remained an intractable problem. Here we report submolecular-resolution imaging of the water clusters on a NaCl(001) surface within the nearly non-invasive region by a qPlus-based noncontact atomic force microscopy. Comparison with theoretical simulations reveals that the key lies in probing the weak high-order electrostatic force between the quadrupole-like CO-terminated tip and the polar water molecules at large tip-water distances. This interaction allows the imaging and structural determination of the weakly bonded water clusters and even of their metastable states without inducing any disturbance. This work may open up new possibility of studying the intrinsic structure and electrostatics of ice or water on bulk insulating surfaces, ion hydration and biological water with atomic precision.

@doi:      10.1021/ci400224z
@abstract:
 Suggestions for improving the Basin-Hopping Monte Carlo (BHMC) algorithm for unbiased global optimization of clusters and nanoparticles are presented. The traditional basin-hopping exploration scheme with Monte Carlo sampling is improved by bringing together novel strategies and techniques employed in different global optimization methods, however, with the care of keeping the underlying algorithm of BHMC unchanged. The improvements include a total of eleven local and nonlocal trial operators tailored for clusters and nanoparticles that allow an efficient exploration of the potential energy surface, two different strategies (static and dynamic) of operator selection, and a filter operator to handle unphysical solutions. In order to assess the efficiency of our strategies, we applied our implementation to several classes of systems, including Lennard-Jones and Sutton-Chen clusters with up to 147 and 148 atoms, respectively, a set of Lennard-Jones nanoparticles with sizes ranging from 200 to 1500 atoms, binary Lennard-Jones clusters with up to 100 atoms, (AgPd)55 alloy clusters described by the Sutton-Chen potential, and aluminum clusters with up to 30 atoms described within the density functional theory framework. Using unbiased global search our implementation was able to reproduce successfully the great majority of all published results for the systems considered and in many cases with more efficiency than the standard BHMC. We were also able to locate previously unknown global minimum structures for some of the systems considered. This revised BHMC method is a valuable tool for aiding theoretical investigations leading to a better understanding of atomic structures of clusters and nanoparticles.

 The cooling dynamics of hot charge carriers in colloidal lead chalcogenide nanocrystals is studied by hyperspectral transient absorption spectroscopy. We demonstrate a transient accumulation of charge carriers at a high energy critical point in the Brillouin zone. Using a theoretical study of the cooling rate in lead chalcogenides, we attribute this slowing down of charge carrier cooling to a phonon scattering bottleneck around this critical point. The relevance of this observation for the possible harvesting of the excess energy of hot carriers by schemes such as multiexciton generation is discussed.

@abstract:
 Electron donor-acceptor molecules are of outstanding interest in molecular electronics and organic solar cells for their intramolecular charge transfer controlled via electrical or optical excitation. The preservation of their electronic character in the ground state upon adsorption on a surface is cardinal for their implementation in such single-molecule devices. Here, we investigate by atomic force microscopy and scanning tunneling microscopy a prototypical system consisting of a $\pi$-conjugated tetrathiafulvalene-fused dipyridophenazine molecule adsorbed on thin NaCl films on Cu(111). Depending on the adsorption site, the molecule is found either in a nearly undisturbed free state or in a bound state. In the latter case, the molecule adopts a specific adsorption site, leading to the formation of a chelate complex with a single Na+ alkali cation pulled out from the insulating film. Although expected to be electronically decoupled, the charge distribution of the complex is drastically modified, leading to the loss of the intrinsic donor-acceptor character. The chelate complex formation is reversible with respect to lateral manipulations, enabling tunable donor-acceptor molecular switches activated by on-surface coordination.

 Biological protein materials feature hierarchical structures that make up a diverse range of physiological materials. The analysis of protein materials is an emerging field that uses the relationships between biological structures, processes and properties to probe deformation and failure phenomena at the molecular and microscopic level. Here we discuss how advanced experimental, computational and theoretical methods can be used to assess structure-process-property relations and to monitor and predict mechanisms associated with failure of protein materials. Case studies are presented to examine failure phenomena in the progression of disease. From this materials science perspective, a de novo basis for understanding biological processes can be used to develop new approaches for treating medical disorders.

@abstract:
 Noncontact atomic force microscopy (NC-AFM) and Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) have become important tools for nanotechnology; however, their contrast mechanisms on the atomic scale are not entirely understood. Here we used chlorine vacancies in NaCl bilayers on Cu(111) as a model system to investigate atomic contrast as a function of applied voltage, tip height, and tip functionalization. We demonstrate that the AFM contrast on the atomic scale decisively depends on both the tip termination and the sample voltage. On the contrary, the local contact potential difference (LCPD) acquired with KPFM showed the same qualitative contrast for all tip terminations investigated, which resembled the contrast of the electric field of the sample. We find that the AFM contrast stems mainly from electrostatic interactions but its tip dependence cannot be explained by the tip dipole alone. With the aid of a simple electrostatic model and by density functional theory we investigate the underlying contrast mechanisms.

 Molecular electronics aims to miniaturize electronic devices by using subnanometre-scale active components. A single-molecule diode, a circuit element that directs current flow, was first proposed more than 40 years ago and consisted of an asymmetric molecule comprising a donor-bridge-acceptor architecture to mimic a semiconductor p-n junction. Several single-molecule diodes have since been realized in junctions featuring asymmetric molecular backbones, molecule-electrode linkers or electrode materials. Despite these advances, molecular diodes have had limited potential for applications due to their low conductance, low rectification ratios, extreme sensitivity to the junction structure and high operating voltages. Here, we demonstrate a powerful approach to induce current rectification in symmetric single-molecule junctions using two electrodes of the same metal, but breaking symmetry by exposing considerably different electrode areas to an ionic solution. This allows us to control the junction's electrostatic environment in an asymmetric fashion by simply changing the bias polarity. With this method, we reliably and reproducibly achieve rectification ratios in excess of 200 at voltages as low as 370 mV using a symmetric oligomer of thiophene-1,1-dioxide. By taking advantage of the changes in the junction environment induced by the presence of an ionic solution, this method provides a general route for tuning nonlinear nanoscale device phenomena, which could potentially be applied in systems beyond single-molecule junctions.

@abstract:
 The conformational flexibility of antibodies in solution directly affects their immune function. Namely, the flexible hinge regions of immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies are essential in epitope-specific antigen recognition and biological effector function. The antibody structure, which is strongly related to its functions, has been partially revealed by electron microscopy and X-ray crystallography, but only under non-physiological conditions. Here we observed monoclonal IgG antibodies in aqueous solution by high-resolution frequency modulation atomic force microscopy (FM-AFM). We found that monoclonal antibodies self-assemble into hexamers, which form two-dimensional crystals in aqueous solution. Furthermore, by directly observing antibody-antigen interactions using FM-AFM, we revealed that IgG molecules in the crystal retain immunoactivity. As the self-assembled monolayer crystal of antibodies retains immunoactivity at a neutral pH and is functionally stable at a wide range of pH and temperature, the antibody crystal is applicable to new biotechnological platforms for biosensors or bioassays.

@abstract:
 In this study, we present some modifications in the semiempirical quantum chemistry MOPAC2009 code that accelerate single-point energy calculations (1SCF) of medium-size (up to 2500 atoms) molecular systems using GPU coprocessors and multithreaded shared-memory CPUs. Our modifications consisted of using a combination of highly optimized linear algebra libraries for both CPU (LAPACK and BLAS from Intel MKL) and GPU (MAGMA and CUBLAS) to hasten time-consuming parts of MOPAC such as the pseudodiagonalization, full diagonalization, and density matrix assembling. We have shown that it is possible to obtain large speedups just by using CPU serial linear algebra libraries in the MOPAC code. As a special case, we show a speedup of up to 14 times for a methanol simulation box containing 2400 atoms and 4800 basis functions, with even greater gains in performance when using multithreaded CPUs (2.1 times in relation to the single-threaded CPU code using linear algebra libraries) and GPUs (3.8 times). This degree of acceleration opens new perspectives for modeling larger structures which appear in inorganic chemistry (such as zeolites and MOFs), biochemistry (such as polysaccharides, small proteins, and DNA fragments), and materials science (such as nanotubes and fullerenes). In addition, we believe that this parallel (GPU-GPU) MOPAC code will make it feasible to use semiempirical methods in lengthy molecular simulations using both hybrid QM/MM and QM/QM potentials. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Chemical Society.

@abstract:
 Graphene nanoribbons-narrow and straight-edged stripes of graphene, or single-layer graphite-are predicted to exhibit electronic properties that make them attractive for the fabrication of nanoscale electronic devices. In particular, although the two-dimensional parent material graphene exhibits semimetallic behaviour, quantum confinement and edge effects should render all graphene nanoribbons with widths smaller than 10 nm semiconducting. But exploring the potential of graphene nanoribbons is hampered by their limited availability: although they have been made using chemical, sonochemical and lithographic methods as well as through the unzipping of carbon nanotubes, the reliable production of graphene nanoribbons smaller than 10 nm with chemical precision remains a significant challenge. Here we report a simple method for the production of atomically precise graphene nanoribbons of different topologies and widths, which uses surface-assisted coupling of molecular precursors into linear polyphenylenes and their subsequent cyclodehydrogenation. The topology, width and edge periphery of the graphene nanoribbon products are defined by the structure of the precursor monomers, which can be designed to give access to a wide range of different graphene nanoribbons. We expect that our bottom-up approach to the atomically precise fabrication of graphene nanoribbons will finally enable detailed experimental investigations of the properties of this exciting class of materials. It should even provide a route to graphene nanoribbon structures with engineered chemical and electronic properties, including the theoretically predicted intraribbon quantum dots, superlattice structures and magnetic devices based on specific graphene nanoribbon edge states.

@abstract:
 Self-assembled DNA nanostructures1 enable nanometre-precise patterning that can be used to create programmable molecular machines2-6 and arrays of functional materials7-9. DNA origami10 is particularly versatile in this context because each DNA strand in the origami nanostructure occupies a unique position and can serve as a uniquely addressable pixel. However, the scale of such structures11-14 has been limited to about 0.05 square micrometres, hindering applications that demand a larger layout15 and integration with more conventional patterning methods. Hierarchical multistage assembly of simple sets of tiles16,17 can in principle overcome this limitation, but so far has not been sufficiently robust to enable successful implementation of larger structures using DNA origami tiles. Here we show that by using simple local assembly rules18 that are modified and applied recursively throughout a hierarchical, multistage assembly process, a small and constant set of unique DNA strands can be used to create DNA origami arrays of increasing size and with arbitrary patterns. We illustrate this method, which we term 'fractal assembly', by producing DNA origami arrays with sizes of up to 0.5 square micrometres and with up to 8,704 pixels, allowing us to render images such as the Mona Lisa and a rooster. We find that self-assembly of the tiles into arrays is unaffected by changes in surface patterns on the tiles, and that the yield of the fractal assembly process corresponds to about 0.95m1 for arrays containing m tiles. When used in conjunction with a software tool that we developed that converts an arbitrary pattern into DNA sequences and experimental protocols, our assembly method is readily accessible and will facilitate the construction of sophisticated materials and devices with sizes similar to that of a bacterium using DNA nanostructures.

@abstract:
 A new Lagrangian formulation is introduced. It can be used to make molecular dynamics (MD) calculations on systems under the most general, externally applied, conditions of stress. In this formulation the MD cell shape and size can change according to dynamical equations given by this Lagrangian. This new MD technique is well suited to the study of structural transformations in solids under external stress and at finite temperature. As an example of the use of this technique we show how a single crystal of Ni behaves under uniform uniaxial compressive and tensile loads. This work confirms some of the results of static (i.e., zero temperature) calculations reported in the literature. We also show that some results regarding the stress‐strain relation obtained by static calculations are invalid at finite temperature. We find that, under compressive loading, our model of Ni shows a bifurcation in its stress‐strain relation; this bifurcation provides a link in configuration space between cubic and hexagonal close packing. It is suggested that such a transformation could perhaps be observed experimentally under extreme conditions of shock.

@abstract:
 Metadynamics calculations of large chemical systems with ab initio methods are computationally prohibitive due to the extensive sampling required to simulate the large degrees of freedom in these systems. To address this computational bottleneck, we utilized a GPU-enhanced density functional tight binding (DFTB) approach on a massively parallelized cloud computing platform to efficiently calculate the thermodynamics and metadynamics of biochemical systems. To first validate our approach, we calculated the free-energy surfaces of alanine dipeptide and showed that our GPU-enhanced DFTB calculations qualitatively agree with computationally-intensive hybrid DFT benchmarks, whereas classical force fields give significant errors. Most importantly, we show that our GPU-accelerated DFTB calculations are significantly faster than previous approaches by up to two orders of magnitude. To further extend our GPU-enhanced DFTB approach, we also carried out a 10 ns metadynamics simulation of remdesivir, which is prohibitively out of reach for routine DFT-based metadynamics calculations. We find that the free-energy surfaces of remdesivir obtained from DFTB and classical force fields differ significantly, where the latter overestimates the internal energy contribution of high free-energy states. Taken together, our benchmark tests, analyses, and extensions to large biochemical systems highlight the use of GPU-enhanced DFTB simulations for efficiently predicting the free-energy surfaces/thermodynamics of large biochemical systems.

@abstract:
 Rotary motion around a molecular axis has been controlled by simple electron transfer processes and by photoexcitation. The basis of the motion is intramolecular rotation of a carborane cage ligand (7,8-dicarbollide) around a nickel axle. The Ni(III) metallacarborane structure is a transoid sandwich with two pairs of carbon vertices reflected through a center of symmetry, but that of the Ni(IV) species is cisoid. The interconversion of the two provides the basis for controlled, rotational, oscillatory motion. The energies of the Ni(III) and Ni(IV) species are calculated as a function of the rotation angle.

@abstract:
 We present a method for the rankwise distributed multipole analysis of an arbitrary distribution of charge and its surrounding field. Using the superposition principle, the electrostatic field created by a distribution of charge can be resolved recursively into the contributions of a set of intrinsic multipole moments "tied to" their rank-specific multipole centers. The positions of the multipole centers, which are fixed with respect to the distribution of charge, are determined from a term-by-term optimization of the Taylor's expansion of the electrostatic potential with respect to the charge coordinates. We describe the recursive construction of the intrinsic multipole moments and derive the algebraic expression of the multipole centers. The resulting distributed multipole expansion provides a conceptual framework for the analysis and modeling of the electrostatic field and of its associated distribution of charge. {\textcopyright} 2008 The American Physical Society.

@abstract:
 In this paper a multi-band envelope-function Hamiltonian for lattice-matched semiconductor heterostructures is derived from first-principles norm-conserving pseudopotentials. The theory is applicable to isovalent or heterovalent heterostructures with macroscopically neutral interfaces and no spontaneous bulk polarization. The key assumption -- proved in earlier numerical studies -- is that the heterostructure can be treated as a weak perturbation with respect to some periodic reference crystal, with the nonlinear response small in comparison to the linear response. Quadratic response theory is then used in conjunction with k.p perturbation theory to develop a multi-band effective-mass Hamiltonian (for slowly varying envelope functions) in which all interface band-mixing effects are determined by the linear response. To within terms of the same order as the position dependence of the effective mass, the quadratic response contributes only a bulk band offset term and an interface dipole term, both of which are diagonal in the effective-mass Hamiltonian. Long-range multipole Coulomb fields arise in quantum wires or dots, but have no qualitative effect in two-dimensional systems beyond a dipole contribution to the band offsets.

 The effect of preparation conditions on the structural and optical properties of silicon nanoparticles is investigated. Nanoscale reconstructions, unique to curved nanosurfaces, are presented for silicon nanocrystals and shown to have lower energy and larger optical gaps than bulk-derived structures. We find that high-temperature synthesis processes can produce metastable noncrystalline nanostructures with different core structures than bulk-derived crystalline clusters. The type of core structure that forms from a given synthesis process may depend on the passivation mechanism and time scale. The effect of oxygen on the optical of different types of silicon structures is calculated. In contrast to the behavior of bulklike nanostructures, for noncrystalline and reconstructed crystalline structures surface oxygen atoms do not decrease the gap. In some cases, the presence of oxygen atoms at the nanocluster surface can significantly increase the optical absorption gap, due to decreased angular distortion of the silicon bonds. The relationship between strain and the optical gap in silicon nanoclusters is discussed.

@abstract:
 Materiomics is an emerging field of science that provides a basis for multiscale material system characterization, inspired in part by natural, for example, protein-based materials. Here we outline the scope and explain the motivation of the field of materiomics, as well as demonstrate the benefits of a materiomic approach in the understanding of biological and natural materials as well as in the design of de novo materials. We discuss recent studies that exemplify the impact of materiomics - discovering Nature's complexity through a materials science approach that merges concepts of material and structure throughout all scales and incorporates feedback loops that facilitate sensing and resulting structural changes at multiple scales. The development and application of materiomics is illustrated for the specific case of protein-based materials, which constitute the building blocks of a variety of biological systems such as tendon, bone, skin, spider silk, cells, and tissue, as well as natural composite material systems (a combination of protein-based and inorganic constituents) such as nacre and mollusk shells, and other natural multiscale systems such as cellulose-based plant and wood materials. An important trait of these materials is that they display distinctive hierarchical structures across multiple scales, where molecular details are exhibited in macroscale mechanical responses. Protein materials are intriguing examples of materials that balance multiple tasks, representing some of the most sustainable material solutions that integrate structure and function despite severe limitations in the quality and quantity of material building blocks. However, up until now, our attempts to analyze and replicate Nature's materials have been hindered by our lack of fundamental understanding of these materials' intricate hierarchical structures, scale-bridging mechanisms, and complex material components that bestow protein-based materials their unique properties. Recent advances in analytical tools and experimental methods allow a holistic view of such a hierarchical biological material system. The integration of these approaches and amalgamation of material properties at all scale levels to develop a complete description of a material system falls within the emerging field of materiomics. Materiomics is the result of the convergence of engineering and materials science with experimental and computational biology in the context of natural and synthetic materials. Through materiomics, fundamental advances in our understanding of structure-property-process relations of biological systems contribute to the mechanistic understanding of certain diseases and facilitate the development of novel biological, biologically inspired, and completely synthetic materials for applications in medicine (biomaterials), nanotechnology, and engineering.

@abstract:
 We report the contrast formation in the local contact potential difference (LCPD) measured by Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) on single charge-transfer complexes (CTCs) on a NaCl bilayer on Cu(111). At different tip heights, we found quantitatively different LCPD contrasts that characterize different properties of the molecule. In the small distance regime, the tip penetrates the electron density of the molecule, and the contrast is related to the size and topography of the electron shell of the molecule. For larger distances, the LCPD contrast corresponds to the electrostatic field above the molecule. However, in the medium-distance regime, that is, for tip heights similar to the size of the molecule, the nonspherical distribution of $\pi$- and $\sigma$-electrons often conceals the effect of the partial charges within the molecule. Only for large distances does the LCPD map converge toward the simple field of a dipole for a polar molecule.

@abstract:
 Newton-Cotes quadrature rules are based on polynomial interpolation in a set of equidistant points. They are very useful in applications where sampled function values are only available on a regular grid. Yet, these rules rapidly become unstable for high orders. In this paper we review two techniques to construct stable high-order quadrature rules using equidistant quadrature points. The stability follows from the fact that all coefficients are positive. This result can be achieved by allowing the number of quadrature points to be larger than the polynomial order of accuracy. The computed approximations then implicitly correspond to the integral of a least squares approximation of the integrand. We show how the underlying discrete least squares approximation can be optimised for the purpose of numerical integration. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

@abstract:
 Hydrogen bonding underpins the properties of a vast array of systems spanning a wide variety of scientific fields. From the elegance of base pair interactions in DNA to the symmetry of extended supramolecular assemblies, hydrogen bonds play an essential role in directing intermolecular forces. Yet fundamental aspects of the hydrogen bond continue to be vigorously debated. Here we use dynamic force microscopy (DFM) to quantitatively map the tip-sample force field for naphthalene tetracarboxylic diimide molecules hydrogen-bonded in two-dimensional assemblies. A comparison of experimental images and force spectra with their simulated counterparts shows that intermolecular contrast arises from repulsive tip-sample interactions whose interpretation can be aided via an examination of charge density depletion across the molecular system. Interpreting DFM images of hydrogen-bonded systems therefore necessitates detailed consideration of the coupled tip-molecule system: analyses based on intermolecular charge density in the absence of the tip fail to capture the essential physical chemistry underpinning the imaging mechanism.

@abstract:
 Scanning probe microscopy makes it possible to image and spectroscopically characterize nanoscale objects, and to manipulate 1-3 and excite 4-8 them; even time-resolved experiments are now routinely achieved 9,10 . This combination of capabilities has enabled proof-of-principle demonstrations of nanoscale devices, including logic operations based on molecular cascades 11, a single-atom transistor 12, a single-atom magnetic memory cell 13 and a kilobyte atomic memory 14 . However, a key challenge is fabricating device structures that can overcome their attraction to the underlying surface and thus protrude from the two-dimensional flatlands of the surface. Here we demonstrate the fabrication of such a structure: we use the tip of a scanning probe microscope to lift a large planar aromatic molecule (3,4,9,10-perylenetetracarboxylic-dianhydride) into an upright, standing geometry on a pedestal of two metal (silver) adatoms. This atypical and surprisingly stable upright orientation of the single molecule, which under all known circumstances adsorbs flat on metals 15,16, enables the system to function as a coherent single-electron field emitter. We anticipate that other metastable adsorbate configurations might also be accessible, thereby opening up the third dimension for the design of functional nanostructures on surfaces.

@abstract:
 Oxygen reduction reaction catalysts based on precious metals such as platinum or its alloys are routinely used in fuel cells because of their high activity. Carbon-supported materials containing metals such as iron or cobalt as well as nitrogen impurities have been proposed to increase scalability and reduce costs, but these alternatives usually suffer from low activity and/or gradual deactivation during use. Here, we show that few-walled carbon nanotubes, following outer wall exfoliation via oxidation and high-temperature reaction with ammonia, can act as an oxygen reduction reaction electrocatalyst in both acidic and alkaline solutions. Under a unique oxidation condition, the outer walls of the few-walled carbon nanotubes are partially unzipped, creating nanoscale sheets of graphene attached to the inner tubes. The graphene sheets contain extremely small amounts of irons originated from nanotube growth seeds, and nitrogen impurities, which facilitate the formation of catalytic sites and boost the activity of the catalyst, as revealed by atomic-scale microscopy and electron energy loss spectroscopy. Whereas the graphene sheets formed from the unzipped part of the outer wall of the nanotubes are responsible for the catalytic activity, the inner walls remain intact and retain their electrical conductivity, which facilitates charge transport during electrocatalysis.

 Molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations were performed to obtain thermodynamic and transport properties of the binary H2O + NaCl system using the polarizable force fields of Kiss and Baranyai ( J. Chem. Phys. 2013 , 138 , 204507 and 2014 , 141 , 114501 ). In particular, liquid densities, electrolyte and crystal chemical potentials of NaCl, salt solubilities, mean ionic activity coefficients, vapor pressures, vapor-liquid interfacial tensions, and viscosities were obtained as functions of temperature, pressure, and salt concentration. We compared the performance of the polarizable force fields against fixed-point-charge (nonpolarizable) models. Most of the properties of interest are better represented by the polarizable models, which also remain physically realistic at elevated temperatures.

 Laboratory generation of strong magnetic fields opens new frontiers in plasma and beam physics, astro- and solar-physics, materials science, and atomic and molecular physics. Although kilotesla magnetic fields have already been produced by magnetic flux compression using an imploding metal tube or plasma shell, accessibility at multiple points and better controlled shapes of the field are desirable. Here we have generated kilotesla magnetic fields using a capacitor-coil target, in which two nickel disks are connected by a U-turn coil. A magnetic flux density of 1.5 kT was measured using the Faraday effect 650 $\mu$m away from the coil, when the capacitor was driven by two beams from the GEKKO-XII laser (at 1 kJ (total), 1.3 ns, 0.53 or 1 $\mu$m, and 5 × 10(16) W/cm(2)).

@abstract:
 Using both first-principles techniques and a real-space Kubo-Greenwood approach, electronic and transport properties of nitrogen-doped graphene with a single sublattice preference are investigated. Such a breaking of the sublattice symmetry leads to the appearance of a true band gap in graphene electronic spectrum even for a random distribution of the N dopants. More surprisingly, a natural spatial separation of both types of charge carriers at the band edge is predicted, leading to a highly asymmetric electronic transport. Both the presence of a band gap, allowing large on/off ratio, and an asymmetric transport pave a new route toward efficient graphene-based field-effect transistors.

 This Letter presents results from the first fully integrated experiments testing the magnetized liner inertial fusion concept [S. A. Slutz et al., Phys. Plasmas 17, 056303 (2010)], in which a cylinder of deuterium gas with a preimposed 10 Taxial magnetic field is heated by Z beamlet, a 2.5 kJ, 1 TWlaser, and magnetically imploded by a 19 MA, 100 ns rise time current on the Z facility. Despite a predicted peak implosion velocity of only 70 km=s, the fuel reaches a stagnation temperature of approximately 3 keV, with Te ≈ Ti, and produces up to 2 × 1012 thermonuclear deuterium-deuterium neutrons. X-ray emission indicates a hot fuel region with full width at half maximum ranging from 60 to 120 $\mu$m over a 6mm height and lasting approximately 2 ns. Greater than 1010 secondary deuterium-tritium neutrons were observed, indicating significant fuel magnetization given that the estimated radial areal density of the plasma is only 2 mg=cm2.

@abstract:
 The high crystallinity of many inorganic materials allows their band structures to be determined through angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). Similar studies of conjugated organic molecules of interest in optoelectronics are often hampered by difficulties in growing well-ordered and well-oriented crystals or films. We have grown crystalline films of uniaxially oriented sexiphenyl molecules and obtained ARPES data. Supported by density-functional calculations, we show that, in the direction parallel to the principal molecular axis, a quasi-one-dimensional band structure of a system of well-defined finite size develops out of individual molecular orbitals. In contrast, perpendicular to the molecules, the band structure reflects the periodicity of the molecular crystal, and continuous bands with a large dispersion were observed.

@abstract:
 The supramolecular structures have been determined for nine adducts formed between organic diamines and ferrocene-1,1'-dicarboxylic acid. In the salt-like 1:1 adduct (1) formed with methylamine, the supramolecular structure is one-dimensional, whereas in the 1:1 adducts formed with 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane, (2), and 4,4'-bipyridyl, (4), and in the hydrated 2:1 adduct (3) formed with morpholine, the hard hydrogen bonds form one-dimensional structures, which are expanded to two dimensions by soft C-H...O hydrogen bonds. The hard hydrogen bonds generate two-dimensional structures in the 2:1 adduct (5) formed with octylamine, where the ferrocene component lies across a centre of inversion, in the 1:1 adduct (6) formed with piperidine and in the tetrahydrofuran-solvated 1:1 adduct (7) formed with di(cyclohexyl)amine. In the 2:3 adduct (8) formed by tris-(2-aminoethyl)amine, and in the 2:1 adduct (9) formed with 2-(4'-hydroxyphenyl)ethylamine (tyramine), where Z' = 1.5 in space group P-1, the hard hydrogen bonds generate three-dimensional structures. No H transfer from O to N occurs in (4) and only partial transfer of H occurs in (2); in (1), (6) and (7), one H is transferred to N from each acid molecule, and in (3), (5), (8) and (9), two H are transferred from each acid molecule.

@abstract:
 We present an optogenetic illumination system capable of real-time light delivery with high spatial resolution to specified targets in freely moving Caenorhabditis elegans. A tracking microscope records the motion of an unrestrained worm expressing channelrhodopsin-2 or halorhodopsin in specific cell types. Image processing software analyzes the worm's position in each video frame, rapidly estimates the locations of targeted cells and instructs a digital micromirror device to illuminate targeted cells with laser light of the appropriate wavelengths to stimulate or inhibit activity. Because each cell in an unrestrained worm is a rapidly moving target, our system operates at high speed (∼50 frames per second) to provide high spatial resolution (∼30 $\mu$m). To test the accuracy, flexibility and utility of our system, we performed optogenetic analyses of the worm motor circuit, egg-laying circuit and mechanosensory circuits that have not been possible with previous methods.

@abstract:
 Coupled-electron pair approximations (CEPAs) and coupled-pair functionals (CPFs) have been popular in the 1970s and 1980s and have yielded excellent results for small molecules. Recently, interest in CEPA and CPF methods has been renewed. It has been shown that these methods lead to competitive thermochemical, kinetic, and structural predictions. They greatly surpass second order Moller-Plesset and popular density functional theory based approaches in accuracy and are intermediate in quality between CCSD and CCSD(T) in extended benchmark studies. In this work an efficient production level implementation of the closed shell CEPA and CPF methods is reported that can be applied to medium sized molecules in the range of 50-100 atoms and up to about 2000 basis functions. The internal space is spanned by localized internal orbitals. The external space is greatly compressed through the method of pair natural orbitals (PNOs) that was also introduced by the pioneers of the CEPA approaches. Our implementation also makes extended use of density fitting (or resolution of the identity) techniques in order to speed up the laborious integral transformations. The method is called local pair natural orbital CEPA (LPNO-CEPA) (LPNO-CPF). The implementation is centered around the concepts of electron pairs and matrix operations. Altogether three cutoff parameters are introduced that control the size of the significant pair list, the average number of PNOs per electron pair, and the number of contributing basis functions per PNO. With the conservatively chosen default values of these thresholds, the method recovers about 99.8{\%} of the canonical correlation energy. This translates to absolute deviations from the canonical result of only a few kcal mol(-1). Extended numerical test calculations demonstrate that LPNO-CEPA (LPNO-CPF) has essentially the same accuracy as parent CEPA (CPF) methods for thermochemistry, kinetics, weak interactions, and potential energy surfaces but is up to 500 times faster. The method performs best in conjunction with large and flexible basis sets. These results open the way for large-scale chemical applications.

@abstract:
 While the interactions between water molecules are dominated by strongly directional hydrogen bonds (HBs), it was recently proposed that relatively weak, isotropic van der Waals (vdW) forces are essential for understanding the properties of liquid water and ice. This insight was derived from ab initio computer simulations, which provide an unbiased description of water at the atomic level and yield information on the underlying molecular forces. However, the high computational cost of such simulations prevents the systematic investigation of the influence of vdW forces on the thermodynamic anomalies of water. Here we develop efficient ab initio-quality neural network potentials and use them to demonstrate that vdW interactions are crucial for the formation of water's density maximum and its negative volume of melting. Both phenomena can be explained by the flexibility of the HB network, which is the result of a delicate balance of weak vdW forces, causing e.g. a pronounced contraction of the second solvation shell upon cooling that induces the density maximum.

As a result, these polymers represent an opportunity for exploring the novel phenomena associated with topological solitons and their linear confinement which results from weakly lifting the ground-state degeneracy. The authors review the theoretical models that have been developed to describe the physics of polyacetylene and related conducting polymers and summarize the relevant experimental results obtained for these materials. An attempt is made to assess the validity of the soliton model of polyacetylene and its generalization to related systems in which the ground-state degeneracy has been lifted.

@title:    Chemical and Steric Effects in Simulating Non-contact Atomic Force Microscopy Images of Organic Molecules on a Cu (111) Substrate
@author:   {Dingxin Fan, *,† Yuki Sakai}, ‡ and James R. Chelikowsky †
@abstract:
 Non-contact mode of atomic force microscopy (nc-AFM) employing a CO-functionalized tip is a very powerful tool for studying molecular structures. However, interpreting nc-AFM images for nonplanar molecules can sometimes be problematic. To illustrate and resolve the nature of such problematic systems, we employ real-space pseudopotentials constructed within density functional theory to simulate nc-AFM images. We focus on several representative nonplanar organic molecules (pentacene, naphthanthrone, olympicene and 6-phenylhexa-1,3,5-triynybenzene (PHTB)) on a typical substrate: the Cu (111) surface. This substrate results in significant distortions in the molecular geometries of pentacene and naphthanthrone. Including these distortions in simulated nc-AFM imaging notably improves the agreement between the simulated and measured images. In naphthanthrone, the relatively large interaction between the O atom and the Cu substrate offers a straightforward explanation for the absence of the C=O bond in the measured image. Nonplanar features such as tilting or twisting are also apparent in olympicene and PHTB. A “triangular” bright feature associated with the -CH2 group in olympicene appears in simulated and measured nc-AFM images. This feature is directly related to the tilting angle of the molecule with respect to the Cu substrate. The “defective” benzene ring feature and the faint ellipsoidal C≡C feature in PHTB can be ascribed to its twisted nature. The ability to simulate such subatomic images in nc-AFM reflects the accuracy and efficiency of calculating quantum forces in real space.

@abstract:
 In monolayer graphene, substitutional doping during growth can be used to alter its electronic properties. We used scanning tunneling microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, x-ray spectroscopy, and first principles calculations to characterize individual nitrogen dopants in monolayer graphene grown on a copper substrate. Individual nitrogen atoms were incorporated as graphitic dopants, and a fraction of the extra electron on each nitrogen atom was delocalized into the graphene lattice. The electronic structure of nitrogen-doped graphene was strongly modified only within a few lattice spacings of the site of the nitrogen dopant. These findings show that chemical doping is a promising route to achieving high-quality graphene films with a large carrier concentration.

@abstract:
 Water-solid interactions are of broad importance both in nature and technology. The hexagonal bilayer model based on the Bernal-Fowler-Pauling ice rules has been widely adopted to describe water structuring at interfaces. Using a cryogenic scanning tunnelling microscope, here we report a new type of two-dimensional ice-like bilayer structure built from cyclic water tetramers on an insulating NaCl(001) film, which is completely beyond this conventional bilayer picture. A novel bridging mechanism allows the interconnection of water tetramers to form chains, flakes and eventually a two-dimensional extended ice bilayer containing a regular array of Bjerrum D-type defects. Ab initio density functional theory calculations substantiate this bridging growth mode and reveal a striking proton-disordered ice structure. The formation of the periodic Bjerrum defects with unusually high density may have a crucial role as H donor sites in directing multilayer ice growth and in catalysing heterogeneous chemical reactions on water-coated salt surfaces.

@url:      http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.02269 https://scipost.org/10.21468/SciPostPhys.2.3.016
@abstract:
 Recent theoretical progress indicates that spacetime and gravity emerge together from the entanglement structure of an underlying microscopic theory. These ideas are best understood in Anti-de Sitter space, where they rely on the area law for entanglement entropy. The extension to de Sitter space requires taking into account the entropy and temperature associated with the cosmological horizon. Using insights from string theory, black hole physics and quantum information theory we argue that the positive dark energy leads to a thermal volume law contribution to the entropy that overtakes the area law precisely at the cosmological horizon. Due to the competition between area and volume law entanglement the microscopic de Sitter states do not thermalise at sub-Hubble scales: they exhibit memory effects in the form of an entropy displacement caused by matter. The emergent laws of gravity contain an additional ‘dark' gravitational force describing the ‘elastic' response due to the entropy displacement. We derive an estimate of the strength of this extra force in terms of the baryonic mass, Newton's constant and the Hubble acceleration scale a{\_}0 =cH{\_}0 a 0 = c H 0 , and provide evidence for the fact that this additional ‘dark gravity force' explains the observed phenomena in galaxies and clusters currently attributed to dark matter.

Up to three hydrogen molecules are attached to one radical. One hydrogen molecule reveals the orientation of the carbon ring and its adsorption site, allowing discrimination between the two radicals. Two hydrogen molecules reflect the bond picture of the carbon skeleton and reveals that adsorption on Cu(111) distorts the meta- isomer differently from its gas-phase distortion.

@abstract:
 Surfactin is a bacterial lipopeptide with powerful surfactant-like properties. High-sensitivity isothermal titration calorimetry was used to study the self association and membrane partitioning of surfactin. The critical micellar concentration (CMC), was 7.5 microM, the heat of micellization was endothermic with DeltaH(w--{\textgreater}m)(Su) = +4.0 kcal/mol, and the free energy of micellization DeltaG(O,w--{\textgreater}m)(Su) = -9.3 kcal/mol (25 degrees C; 100 mM NaCl; 10 mM TRIS, 1 mM EDTA; pH 8.5). The specific heat capacity of micellization was deduced from temperature dependence of DeltaH(w--{\textgreater}m)(Su) as DeltaC(w--{\textgreater}m)(P) = -250 +/- 10 cal/(mol.K). The data can be explained by combining the hydrophobicity of the fatty acyl chain with that of the hydrophobic amino acids. The membrane partition equilibrium was studied using small (30 nm) and large (100 nm) unilamellar POPC vesicles. At 25 degrees C, the partition coefficient, K, was (2.2 +/- 0.2) x 10(4) M(-1) for large vesicles leading to a free energy of DeltaG(O, w--{\textgreater}b)(Su) = -8.3 kcal/mol. The partition enthalpy was again endothermic, with DeltaH(w--{\textgreater}b)(Su) = 9 +/- 1 kcal/mol. The strong preference of surfactin for micelle formation over membrane insertion explains the high membrane-destabilizing activity of the peptide. For surfactin and a variety of non-ionic detergents, the surfactant-to-lipid ratio, inducing membrane solubilization, R(sat)(b), can be predicted by the simple relationship R(sat)(b) approximately K. CMC.

@abstract:
 We demonstrate that the atom-based charge model implemented in the current versions of the density functional tight binding (DFTB) method fails to reproduce the correct charge distribution of a range of systems, including homonuclear molecules, graphene, and nanotubes, resulting in serious distortions in the electrostatic interactions for such systems caused by the missing quadrupole moments. In particular, this failure seriously impacts the long- and medium-range interaction energies of the DFTB plus dispersion (DFTB-D) model, leading to incorrect predictions of translational or rotational barriers in such systems. We show explicitly on examples of H2 and N2 that correct quadrupole moments - and consequently correct electrostatic interactions - can be restored in such systems by adding additional bond (ghost) sites to the homonuclear molecules. Attempts to determine the point charges associated with the additional sites using the usual Mulliken population analysis lead to unphysical results. Instead, these charges can be determined using the actual DFTB densities used in the parameterization process. For homonuclear molecules, we propose an extension to the DFTB-D model by adding charges that reproduce the physically correct quadrupolar charge distribution. The resulting DFTB-D-Q model greatly improves the rotational barriers for interactions of molecular hydrogen and nitrogen with benzene.

@abstract:
 Modern computers operate at enormous speeds - capable of executing in excess of 10{\^{}}13 instructions per second - but their sequential approach to processing, by which logical operations are performed one after another, has remained unchanged since the 1950s. In contrast, although individual neurons of the human brain fire at around just 10{\^{}}3 times per second, the simultaneous collective action of millions of neurons enables them to complete certain tasks more efficiently than even the fastest supercomputer. Here we demonstrate an assembly of molecular switches that simultaneously interact to perform a variety of computational tasks including conventional digital logic, calculating Voronoi diagrams, and simulating natural phenomena such as heat diffusion and cancer growth. As well as representing a conceptual shift from serial-processing with static architectures, our parallel, dynamically reconfigurable approach could provide a means to solve otherwise intractable computational problems.

@abstract:
 We demonstrate that, at constant temperature, hundreds of DNA strands can cooperatively fold a long template DNA strand within minutes into complex nanoscale objects. Folding occurred out of equilibrium along nucleation-driven pathways at temperatures that could be influenced by the choice of sequences, strand lengths, and chain topology. Unfolding occurred in apparent equilibrium at higher temperatures than those for folding. Folding at optimized constant temperatures enabled the rapid production of three-dimensional DNA objects with yields that approached 100{\%}. The results point to similarities with protein folding in spite of chemical and structural differences. The possibility for rapid and high-yield assembly will enable DNA nanotechnology for practical applications.

@abstract:
 The bonding and organization of 1,1,2,3,4,5-hexapheny- silole (HPS) molecules adsorbed on Cu(111) and Ag(111) surfaces has been investigated using low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. In room-temperature-prepared samples, HPS molecules form extended networks that exhibit hierarchical organization stabilized by $\pi$−$\pi$ interaction between exocyclic phenyl groups. After 430 K annealing on Cu(111), the compound is chemically altered as evidenced by Si 2p core level shift. This change is accompanied by a different adsorption configuration and a transformation of the assembled structures from networks to uniformly sized chiral clusters. The clusters, each composed of three molecules, are dispersively distributed on the surface. Monte Carlo simulations signal that this new phase can be understood as a result of competing long-range repulsions and short-range attractions. After even higher annealing at 520 K, the clusters dissolve and the exocyclic phenyl moieties undergo a cyclodehydrogenation reaction to form a polycyclic aromatic compound incorporating a silole moiety. In sharp contrast, on Ag(111), the HPS molecules do not show these changes but desorb from the surface at elevated temperatures. Our results demonstrate that the two-dimensional supramolecular assembly of intact HPS is insensitive to the choice of substrate at room temperature, but at high temperatures, the substrate's chemical activity can induce selective chemical transformations resulting in a significantly different assembly behavior

@abstract:
 Natural computers exploit the emergent properties and massive parallelism of interconnected networks of locally active components. Evolution has resulted in systems that compute quickly and that use energy efficiently, utilizing whatever physical properties are exploitable. Man-made computers, on the other hand, are based on circuits of functional units that follow given design rules. Hence, potentially exploitable physical processes, such as capacitive crosstalk, to solve a problem are left out. Until now, designless nanoscale networks of inanimate matter that exhibit robust computational functionality had not been realized. Here we artificially evolve the electrical properties of a disordered nanomaterials system (by optimizing the values of control voltages using a genetic algorithm) to perform computational tasks reconfigurably. We exploit the rich behaviour that emerges from interconnected metal nanoparticles, which act as strongly nonlinear single-electron transistors, and find that this nanoscale architecture can be configured in situ into any Boolean logic gate. This universal, reconfigurable gate would require about ten transistors in a conventional circuit. Our system meets the criteria for the physical realization of (cellular) neural networks: universality (arbitrary Boolean functions), compactness, robustness and evolvability, which implies scalability to perform more advanced tasks. Our evolutionary approach works around device-to-device variations and the accompanying uncertainties in performance. Moreover, it bears a great potential for more energy-efficient computation, and for solving problems that are very hard to tackle in conventional architectures.

@abstract:
 We studied the dynamics of a single cobalt (Co) atom during lateral manipulation on a copper (111) surface in a low-temperature scanning tunneling microscope. The Co binding site locations were revealed in a detailed image that resulted from lateral Co atom motion within the trapping potential of the scanning tip. Random telegraph noise, corresponding to the Co atom switching between hexagonal close-packed (hcp) and face-centered cubic (fcc) sites, was seen when the tip was used to try to position the Co atom over the higher energy hcp site. Varying the probe tip height modified the normal copper (111) potential landscape and allowed the residence time of the Co atom in these sites to be varied. At low tunneling voltages (less than approximately 5 millielectron volts), the transfer rate between sites was independent of tunneling voltage, current, and temperature. At higher voltages, the transfer rate exhibited a strong dependence on tunneling voltage, indicative of vibrational heating by inelastic electron scattering.

@abstract:
 Nanoporous molecular frameworks 1–7 are important in applica-tions such as separation, storage and catalysis. Empirical rules exist for their assembly but it is still challenging to place and segregate functionality in three-dimensional porous solids in a predictable way. Indeed, recent studies of mixed crystalline frameworks suggest a preference for the statistical distribution of functionalities throughout the pores 7 rather than, for example, the functional group localization found in the reactive sites of enzymes 8 . This is a potential limitation for 'one-pot' chemical syntheses of porous frameworks from simple starting materials. An alternative strategy is to prepare porous solids from synthetically preorganized molecu-lar pores 9–15 . In principle, functional organic pore modules could be covalently prefabricated and then assembled to produce materials with specific properties. However, this vision of mix-and-match assembly is far from being realized, not least because of the chal-lenge in reliably predicting three-dimensional structures for molecular crystals, which lack the strong directional bonding found in networks. Here we show that highly porous crystalline solids can be produced by mixing different organic cage modules that self-assemble by means of chiral recognition. The structures of the resulting materials can be predicted computationally 16,17

 Investigating the properties of protons in water is essential for$\backslash$nunderstanding many chemical processes in aqueous solution.

@abstract:
 Recent advances in experimental structure determination provide a wealth of structural data on huge macromolecular assemblies such as the ribosome or viral capsids, available in public databases. Further structural models arise from reconstructions using symmetry orders or fitting crystal structures into low-resolution maps obtained by electron-microscopy or small angle X-ray scattering experiments. Visual inspection of these huge structures remains an important way of unravelling some of their secrets. However, such visualization cannot conveniently be carried out using conventional rendering approaches, either due to performance limitations or due to lack of realism. Recent developments, in particular drawing benefit from the capabilities of Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), herald the next generation of molecular visualization solutions addressing these issues. In this article, we present advances in computer science and visualization that help biologists visualize, understand and manipulate large and complex molecular systems, introducing concepts that remain little-known in the bioinformatics field. Furthermore, we compile currently available software and methods enhancing the shape perception of such macromolecular assemblies, for example based on surface simplification or lighting ameliorations. {\textcopyright} The Author 2011.

@abstract:
 Spider silks are renowned for their excellent mechanical properties and biomimetic and industrial potentials. They are formed from the natural refolding of water-soluble fibroins with alpha-helical and random coil structures in silk glands into insoluble fibers with mainly beta-structures. The structures of the fibroins at atomic resolution and silk formation mechanism remain largely unknown. Here, we report the 3D structures of individual domains of a approximately 366-kDa eggcase silk protein that consists of 20 identical type 1 repetitive domains, one type 2 repetitive domain, and conserved nonrepetitive N- and C-terminal domains. The structures of the individual domains in solution were determined by using NMR techniques. The domain interactions were investigated by NMR and dynamic light-scattering techniques. The formation of micelles and macroscopic fibers from the domains was examined by electron microscopy. We find that either of the terminal domains covalently linked with at least one repetitive domain spontaneously forms micelle-like structures and can be further transformed into fibers at {\textgreater} or = 37 degrees C and a protein concentration of {\textgreater} 0.1 wt{\%}. Our biophysical and biochemical experiments indicate that the less hydrophilic terminal domains initiate the assembly of the proteins and form the outer layer of the micelles whereas the more hydrophilic repetitive domains are embedded inside to ensure the formation of the micelle-like structures that are the essential intermediates in silk formation. Our results establish the roles of individual silk protein domains in fiber formation and provide the basis for designing miniature fibroins for producing artificial silks.

@abstract:
 Recently, the family of high-resolution scanning probe imaging techniques using decorated tips has been complemented by a method based on inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy (IETS). The new technique resolves the inner structure of organic molecules by mapping the vibrational energy of a single carbon monoxide (CO) molecule positioned at the apex of a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) tip. Here, we explain high-resolution IETS imaging by extending a model developed earlier for STM and atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging with decorated tips. In particular, we show that the tip decorated with CO acts as a nanoscale sensor that changes the energy of its frustrated translation mode in response to changes of the local curvature of the surface potential. In addition, we show that high resolution AFM, STM, and IETS-STM images can deliver information about the charge distribution within molecules deposited on a surface. To demonstrate this, we extend our mechanical model by taking into account electrostatic forces acting on the decorated tip in the surface Hartree potential.

@abstract:
 Nonradiative recombination of excitations in semiconductors limits the performance of photovoltaics, light-emitting diodes, photocatalysts, and other devices. Herein we investigate the role that two known defects on the oxidized surface of silicon play in nonradiative recombination in silicon nanocrystals. We apply ab initio multiple spawning and multireference electronic structure methods to model the nonradiative processes which follow excitation of two cluster models of silicon epoxide defects that differ in the oxidation state of their respective silicon atoms. We find conical intersections in both clusters, and these intersections are found to be accessible at energies corresponding to visible wavelengths. In both cases, photochemical opening of the epoxide ring precedes nonradiative decay. These results support the hypothesis that conical intersections associated with specific defect structures on the oxidized surface of silicon nanocrystals facilitate nonradiative recombination. Discussion regarding how this hypothesis can be tested experimentally is presented.

@abstract:
 Conceptual design activities of the first fusion power plants were launched in recent years with a view to putting them into operation by 2050. Nuclear fusion offers significant benefits in comparison with exploited energy sources, especially limitless fuel reserves, inherent nuclear safety, and negligible impact on the environment. The challenge is a high heat and neutron loading of the fusion reactors nuclear zone. The paper brings the ex-ante economic analysis of the fusion power plant model DEMO2 in terms of the cost of electricity. The model investment and operating costs are presented. The limit sales price of electricity was found using the net present value method. The levelized cost of electricity LCOE method with the inclusion of external costs is used for a comparison of selected power plant types based on the OECD statistical data and the EU ExternE project results. The comparison shows the levelized cost of electricity of fusion power plants competitive to the actual renewable resources. After internalisation of external costs, the fusion power plants should become even the second cheapest power source.

@abstract:
 The primary metric for gauging progress in the various semiconductor integrated circuit technologies is the spacing, or pitch, between the most closely spaced wires within a dynamic random access memory (DRAM) circuit. Modern DRAM circuits have 140 nm pitch wires and a memory cell size of 0.0408 mum(2). Improving integrated circuit technology will require that these dimensions decrease over time. However, at present a large fraction of the patterning and materials requirements that we expect to need for the construction of new integrated circuit technologies in 2013 have 'no known solution'. Promising ingredients for advances in integrated circuit technology are nanowires, molecular electronics and defect-tolerant architectures, as demonstrated by reports of single devices and small circuits. Methods of extending these approaches to large-scale, high-density circuitry are largely undeveloped. Here we describe a 160,000-bit molecular electronic memory circuit, fabricated at a density of 10(11) bits cm(-2) (pitch 33 nm; memory cell size 0.0011 microm2), that is, roughly analogous to the dimensions of a DRAM circuit projected to be available by 2020. A monolayer of bistable, [2]rotaxane molecules served as the data storage elements. Although the circuit has large numbers of defects, those defects could be readily identified through electronic testing and isolated using software coding. The working bits were then configured to form a fully functional random access memory circuit for storing and retrieving information.

We used noncontact atomic force microscopy to investigate reaction-induced changes in the detailed internal bond structure of individual oligo-(phenylene-1,2-ethynylenes) on a (100) oriented silver surface as they underwent a series of cyclization processes. Our images reveal the complex surface reaction mechanisms underlying thermally induced cyclization cascades of enediynes.

@doi:      10.1039/d1sc06324c
@abstract:
 The use of machine learning techniques in computational chemistry has gained significant momentum since large molecular databases are now readily available. Predictions of molecular properties using machine learning have advantages over the traditional quantum mechanics calculations because they can be cheaper computationally without losing the accuracy. We present a new extrapolatable and explainable molecular representation based on bonds, angles and dihedrals that can be used to train machine learning models. The trained models can accurately predict the electronic energy and the free energy of small organic molecules with atom types C, H N and O, with a mean absolute error of 1.2 kcal mol−1. The models can be extrapolated to larger organic molecules with an average error of less than 3.7 kcal mol−1 for 10 or fewer heavy atoms, which represent a chemical space two orders of magnitude larger. The rapid energy predictions of multiple molecules, up to 7 times faster than previous ML models of similar accuracy, has been achieved by sampling geometries around the potential energy surface minima. Therefore, the input geometries do not have to be located precisely on the minima and we show that accurate density functional theory energy predictions can be made from force-field optimised geometries with a mean absolute error 2.5 kcal mol−1

@abstract:
 MOTIVATION: Similarity searching and clustering of chemical compounds by structural similarities are important computational approaches for identifying drug-like small molecules. Most algorithms available for these tasks are limited by their speed and scalability, and cannot handle today's large compound databases with several million entries. RESULTS: In this article, we introduce a new algorithm for accelerated similarity searching and clustering of very large compound sets using embedding and indexing (EI) techniques. First, we present EI-Search as a general purpose similarity search method for finding objects with similar features in large databases and apply it here to searching and clustering of large compound sets. The method embeds the compounds in a high-dimensional Euclidean space and searches this space using an efficient index-aware nearest neighbor search method based on locality sensitive hashing (LSH). Second, to cluster large compound sets, we introduce the EI-Clustering algorithm that combines the EI-Search method with Jarvis-Patrick clustering. Both methods were tested on three large datasets with sizes ranging from about 260 000 to over 19 million compounds. In comparison to sequential search methods, the EI-Search method was 40-200 times faster, while maintaining comparable recall rates. The EI-Clustering method allowed us to significantly reduce the CPU time required to cluster these large compound libraries from several months to only a few days. AVAILABILITY: Software implementations and online services have been developed based on the methods introduced in this study. The online services provide access to the generated clustering results and ultra-fast similarity searching of the PubChem Compound database with subsecond response time.

@abstract:
 Glaser-like coupling of terminal alkynes by thermal activation is extensively used in on-surface chemistry. Here we demonstrate an intramolecular version of this reaction performed by atom manipulation. We used voltage pulses from the tip to trigger a Glaser-like coupling between terminal alkyne carbons within a custom-synthesized precursor molecule adsorbed on bilayer NaCl on Cu(111). Different conformations of the precursor molecule and the product were characterized by molecular structure elucidation with atomic force microscopy and orbital density mapping with scanning tunneling microscopy, accompanied by density functional theory calculations. We revealed partially dehydrogenated intermediates, providing insight into the reaction pathway.

@abstract:
 A novel strategy for efficient growth of nitrogen-doped graphene (N-graphene) on a large scale from s-triazine molecules is presented. The growth process has been unveiled in situ using time-dependent photoemission. It has been established that a postannealing of N-graphene after gold intercalation causes a conversion of the N environment from pyridinic to graphitic, allowing to obtain more than 80{\%} of all embedded nitrogen in graphitic form, which is essential for the electron doping in graphene. A band gap, a doping level of 300 meV, and a charge-carrier concentration of ∼8×10(12) electrons per cm2, induced by 0.4 atom {\%} of graphitic nitrogen, have been detected by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, which offers great promise for implementation of this system in next generation electronic devices.

@abstract:
 Calculations of interaction energies of noncovalent interactions in small basis sets are affected by the basis set superposition error and dispersion-corrected DFT-D methods and are thus usually parametrized only for triple-Ζ and larger basis sets. Nevertheless, some smaller basis sets could also perform well. Among many combinations tested, we obtained excellent results with the DZVP-DFT basis and newly parametrized D3 dispersion correction. The accuracy of interaction energies and geometries is close to significantly more expensive calculations.

@abstract:
 The “High-Foot” platform manipulates the laser pulse-shape coming from the National Ignition Facility laser to create an indirect drive 3-shock implosion that is significantly more robust against instability growth involving the ablator and also modestly reduces implosion convergence ratio. This strategy gives up on theoretical high-gain in an inertial confinement fusion implosion in order to obtain better control of the implosion and bring experimental performance in-line with calculated performance, yet keeps the absolute capsule performance relatively high. In this paper, we will cover the various experimental and theoretical motivations for the high-foot drive as well as cover the experimental results that have come out of the high-foot experimental campaign. At the time of this writing, the high-foot implosion has demonstrated record total deuterium-tritium yields ( 9.3 × 10 15 ) with low levels of inferred mix, excellent agreement with implosion simulations, fuel energy gains exceeding unity, and evidence for the “bootstrapping” associated with alpha-particle self-heating.

@abstract:
 Templates are widely used to arrange molecular components so they can be covalently linked into complex molecules that are not readily accessible by classical synthetic methods. Nature uses sophisticated templates such as the ribosome, whereas chemists use simple ions or small molecules. But as we tackle the synthesis of larger targets, we require larger templates-which themselves become synthetically challenging. Here we show that Vernier complexes can solve this problem: if the number of binding sites on the template, n(T), is not a multiple of the number of binding sites on the molecular building blocks, n(B), then small templates can direct the assembly of relatively large Vernier complexes where the number of binding sites in the product, n(P), is the lowest common multiple of n(B) and n(T) (refs 8, 9). We illustrate the value of this concept for the covalent synthesis of challenging targets by using a simple six-site template to direct the synthesis of a 12-porphyrin nano-ring with a diameter of 4.7 nm, thus establishing Vernier templating as a powerful new strategy for the synthesis of large monodisperse macromolecules.

 Pharmaceutical research has successfully incorporated a wealth of molecular modeling methods, within a variety of drug discovery programs, to study complex biological and chemical systems. The integration of computational and experimental strategies has been of great value in the identification and development of novel promising compounds. Broadly used in modern drug design, molecular docking methods explore the ligand conformations adopted within the binding sites of macromolecular targets. This approach also estimates the ligand-receptor binding free energy by evaluating critical phenomena involved in the intermolecular recognition process. Today, as a variety of docking algorithms are available, an understanding of the advantages and limitations of each method is of fundamental importance in the development of effective strategies and the generation of relevant results. The purpose of this review is to examine current molecular docking strategies used in drug discovery and medicinal chemistry, exploring the advances in the field and the role played by the integration of structure- and ligand-based methods.

@abstract:
 In this review we chart recent advances in what is at once an old and very new field of endeavour--the achievement of control of motion at the molecular level including solid-state and surface-mounted rotors, and its natural progression to the development of synthetic molecular machines. Besides a discussion of design principles used to control linear and rotary motion in such molecular systems, this review will address the advances towards the construction of synthetic machines that can perform useful functions. Approaches taken by several research groups to construct wholly synthetic molecular machines and devices are compared. This will be illustrated with molecular rotors, elevators, valves, transporters, muscles and other motor functions used to develop smart materials. The demonstration of molecular machinery is highlighted through recent examples of systems capable of effecting macroscopic movement through concerted molecular motion. Several approaches to illustrate how molecular motor systems have been used to accomplish work are discussed. We will conclude with prospects for future developments in this exciting field of nanotechnology.

@abstract:
 This article reviews some recent work on the energy analysis of agriculture, which shows that the efficiency of‘modernf agriculture is inferior to that of‘traditionalf agriculture. We consider one of the first examples of energy accounting in agriculture (published by Sergei Podolinsky one hundred years ago), and we evaluate Engelss reaction to it, in correspondence with Marx. This article is, then, an attempt to explore whether energy analysis can be fitted into the Marxist framework, and our conclusion is that Marxism would have to be much revised since there are epistemological obstacles (the use of categories from Political Economy, such as production ‘labour-value', ‘capital') and ideological obstacles (the vision of a two-stage transition to communist abundance and equality). Although some Marxist anthropologists have used energy analysis, most Marxist economic historians and economists have not, i. e. they have not looked critically at the notion of‘development ofproductive forces. We trace the origins of this divorce between Marxism and ecology. {\textcopyright} 1982, Taylor {\&} Francis Group, LLC. All rights reserved.

@abstract:
 Double-hybrid density functionals (DHDFs) are reviewed in this study. In DHDFs parts of conventional density functional theory (DFT) exchange and correlation are replaced by contributions from nonlocal Fock-exchange and second-order perturbative correlation. The latter portion is based on the well-known MP2 wave-function approach in which, however, Kohn-Sham orbitals are used to calculate its contribution. First, related methods preceding this idea are reviewed, followed by a thorough discussion of the first modern double-hybrid B2-PLYP. Parallels and differences between B2-PLYP and its various successors are then outlined. This discussion is rounded off with representative thermochemical examples demonstrating that DHDFs belong to the most robust and accurate DFT approaches currently available. This analysis also presents hitherto unpublished results for recently developed DHDFs. Finally, how double-hybrids can be combined with linear-response time-dependent DFT is also outlined and the value of this approach for electronically excited states is shown.

@abstract:
 Deep learning is revolutionizing many areas of science and technology, especially image, text and speech recognition. In this paper, we demonstrate how a deep neural network (NN) trained on quantum mechanical (QM) DFT calculations can learn an accurate and fully transferable potential for organic molecules. We introduce ANAKIN-ME (Accurate NeurAl networK engINe for Molecular Energies) or ANI in short. ANI is a new method and procedure for training neural network potentials that utilizes a highly modified version of the Behler and Parrinello symmetry functions to build single-atom atomic environment vectors as a molecular representation. We utilize ANI to build a potential called ANI-1, which was trained on a subset of the GDB databases with up to 8 heavy atoms to predict total energies for organic molecules containing four atom types: H, C, N, and O. To obtain an accelerated but physically relevant sampling of molecular potential surfaces, we also propose a Normal Mode Sampling (NMS) method for generating molecular configurations. Through a series of case studies, we show that ANI-1 is chemically accurate compared to reference DFT calculations on much larger molecular systems (up to 54 atoms) than those included in the training data set, with root mean square errors as low as 0.56 kcal/mol.

@abstract:
 DFTB+ is a versatile community developed open source software package offering fast and efficient methods for carrying out atomistic quantum mechanical simulations. By implementing various methods approximating density functional theory (DFT), such as the density functional based tight binding (DFTB) and the extended tight binding method, it enables simulations of large systems and long timescales with reasonable accuracy while being considerably faster for typical simulations than the respective ab initio methods. Based on the DFTB framework, it additionally offers approximated versions of various DFT extensions including hybrid functionals, time dependent formalism for treating excited systems, electron transport using non-equilibrium Green's functions, and many more. DFTB+ can be used as a user-friendly standalone application in addition to being embedded into other software packages as a library or acting as a calculation-server accessed by socket communication. We give an overview of the recently developed capabilities of the DFTB+ code, demonstrating with a few use case examples, discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the various features, and also discuss on-going developments and possible future perspectives.

@abstract:
 The effects of melatonin, amlodipine, diltiazem (L-type Ca 2+ channel blockers) and $\omega$-conotoxin (N-type Ca 2+ channel blocker) on the glutamate-dependent excitatory response of striatal neurones to sensory-motor cortex stimulation was studied in a total of 111 neurones. Iontophoresis of melatonin produced a significant attenuation of the excitatory response in 85.2{\%} of the neurones with a latency period of 2 min. Iontophoresis of either L- or N-type Ca 2+ channel blocker also produced a significant attenuation of the excitatory response in more than 50{\%} of the recorded neurones without significant latency. The simultaneous iontophoresis of melatonin + amlodipine or melatonin + diltiazem did not increase the attenuation produced by melatonin alone. However, the attenuation of the excitatory response was significantly higher after ejecting melatonin + $\omega$-conotoxin than after ejecting melatonin alone. The melatonin-Ca 2+ relationship was further supported by iontophoresis of the Ca 2+ ionophore A-23187, which suppressed the inhibitory effect of either melatonin or Ca 2+ antagonists. In addition, in synaptosomes prepared from rat striatum, melatonin produced a decrease in the Ca 2+ influx measured by Fura-2AM fluorescence. Binding experiments with [ 3 H]MK-801 in membrane preparations from rat striatum showed that melatonin did not compete with the MK-801 binding sites themselves although, in the presence of Mg 2+ , melatonin increased the affinity of MK-801. The results suggest that decreased Ca 2+ influx is involved in the inhibitory effects of melatonin on the glutamatergic activity of rat striatum.

 This chapter provides a brief introduction to box and half-box splines with particular focus on triangular splines and surface design. A particular exam- ple of box splines are the B-splines with equidistant knots. In general, box splines consist of regularly arranged polynomial pieces and they have a useful geometric interpretation. Namely they can be viewed as density functions of the shadows of higher dimensional boxes and half-boxes. Of particular in- terest for Geometric Design are box spline surfaces that consist of triangular polynomial pieces. These box spline surfaces have planar domains, but it is quite simple to construct arbitrary two-dimensional surfaces, i.e., manifolds, with these box splines.

@abstract:
 One of the paramount goals in nanotechnology is molecular-scale functional design, which includes arranging molecules into complex structures at will. The first steps towards this goal were made through the invention of the scanning probe microscope (SPM), which put single-atom and single-molecule manipulation into practice for the first time. Extending the controlled manipulation to larger molecules is expected to multiply the potential of engineered nanostructures. Here we report an enhancement of the SPM technique that makes the manipulation of large molecular adsorbates much more effective. By using a commercial motion tracking system, we couple the movements of an operator's hand to the sub-angstrom precise positioning of an SPM tip. Literally moving the tip by hand we write a nanoscale structure in a monolayer of large molecules, thereby showing that our method allows for the successful execution of complex manipulation protocols even when the potential energy surface that governs the interaction behaviour of the manipulated nanoscale object(s) is largely unknown.

@abstract:
 We investigate the structural and electronic properties of nitrogen-doped epitaxial monolayer graphene and quasifreestanding monolayer graphene on 6H-SiC(0001) by the normal incidence x-ray standing wave technique and by angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy supported by density functional theory simulations. With the location of various nitrogen species uniquely identified, we observe that for the same doping procedure, the graphene support, consisting of substrate and interface, strongly influences the structural as well as the electronic properties of the resulting doped graphene layer. Compared to epitaxial graphene, quasifreestanding graphene is found to contain fewer nitrogen dopants. However, this lack of dopants is compensated by the proximity of nitrogen atoms at the interface that yield a similar number of charge carriers in graphene.

 An emerging field of chemistry involves construction of highly organized chromophoric complexes that can be applicable to photonic and electronic nanomaterials. While in nature highly sophisticated chromophoric complexes with spatially arranged pigments are constructed by the help of protein manifolds through the synergetic action of diverse kind of noncovalent interactions, the construction of such complexes in artificial system is accompanied by tremendous difficulty. The use of directional and specific noncovalent interaction enables us to prepare artificial chromophoric complexes without use of biopolymer scaffolds. This review manifests the usefulness of multiple hydrogen-bonding interactions to obtain functional chromophoric complexes. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

@abstract:
 Kohn-Sham density functional theory (DFT) is a standard tool in most branches of chemistry, but accuracies for many molecules are limited to 2-3 kcal ⋅ mol−1 with presently-available functionals. Ab initio methods, such as coupled-cluster, routinely produce much higher accuracy, but computational costs limit their application to small molecules. In this paper, we leverage machine learning to calculate coupled-cluster energies from DFT densities, reaching quantum chemical accuracy (errors below 1 kcal ⋅ mol−1) on test data. Moreover, density-based $\Delta$-learning (learning only the correction to a standard DFT calculation, termed $\Delta$-DFT) significantly reduces the amount of training data required, particularly when molecular symmetries are included. The robustness of $\Delta$-DFT is highlighted by correcting “on the fly” DFT-based molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of resorcinol (C6H4(OH)2) to obtain MD trajectories with coupled-cluster accuracy. We conclude, therefore, that $\Delta$-DFT facilitates running gas-phase MD simulations with quantum chemical accuracy, even for strained geometries and conformer changes where standard DFT fails.

@abstract:
 MP2 and CCSD(T) complete basis set (CBS) limit interaction energies and geometries for more than 100 DNA base pairs, amino acid pairs and model complexes are for the first time presented together. Extrapolation to the CBS limit is done by using two-point extrapolation methods and different basis sets (aug-cc-pVDZ - aug-cc-pVTZ, aug-cc-pVTZ - aug-cc-pVQZ, cc-pVTZ - cc-pVQZ) are utilized. The CCSD(T) correction term, determined as a difference between CCSD(T) and MP2 interaction energies, is evaluated with smaller basis sets (6-31G** and cc-pVDZ). Two sets of complex geometries were used, optimized or experimental ones. The JSCH-2005 benchmark set, which is now available to the chemical community, can be used for testing lower-level computational methods. For the first screening the smaller training set (S22) containing 22 model complexes can be recommended. In this case larger basis sets were used for extrapolation to the CBS limit and also CCSD(T) and counterpoise-corrected MP2 optimized geometries were sometimes adopted.

 The accuracy of the results obtained in molecular dynamics or Monte Carlo simulations crucially depends on a reliable description of the atomic interactions. A large variety of efficient potentials has been proposed in the literature, but often the optimum functional form is difficult to find and strongly depends on the particular system. In recent years, artificial neural networks (NN) have become a promising new method to construct potentials for a wide range of systems. They offer a number of advantages: they are very general and applicable to systems as different as small molecules, semiconductors and metals; they are numerically very accurate and fast to evaluate; and they can be constructed using any electronic structure method. Significant progress has been made in recent years and a number of successful applications demonstrate the capabilities of neural network potentials. In this Perspective, the current status of NN potentials is reviewed, and their advantages and limitations are discussed.

@url:      http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/9806102
@abstract:
 Bohr and Heisenberg suggested that the thermodynamical quantities of temperature and energy are complementary in the same way as position and momentum in quantum mechanics. Roughly speaking, their idea was that a definite temperature can be attributed to a system only if it is submerged in a heat bath, in which case energy fluctuations are unavoidable. On the other hand, a definite energy can only be assigned to systems in thermal isolation, thus excluding the simultaneous determination of its temperature. Rosenfeld extended this analogy with quantum mechanics and obtained a quantitative uncertainty relation in the form (Delta U) (Delta (1/T)) {\textgreater}= k where k is Boltzmann's constant. The two `extreme' cases of this relation would then characterize this complementarity between isolation (U definite) and contact with a heat bath (T definite). Other formulations of the thermodynamical uncertainty relations were proposed by Mandelbrot (1956, 1989), Lindhard (1986) and Lavenda (1987, 1991). This work, however, has not led to a consensus in the literature. It is shown here that the uncertainty relation for temperature and energy in the version of Mandelbrot is indeed exactly analogous to modern formulations of the quantum mechanical uncertainty relations. However, his relation holds only for the canonical distribution, describing a system in contact with a heat bath. There is, therefore, no complementarity between this situation and a thermally isolated system.

@abstract:
 We present a method for enhancing the sampling of configuration space in molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations of systems exhibiting high potential energy barriers. The method builds on a previously described approach, "puddle-skimming", in which the potential energy function, V(q), is modified as follows: wherever V(q) {\textless} EB, it is set equal to EB, where EB is a selected "puddle height". V(q) is unmodified in regions where V(q) {\textgreater} EB. The extended method, "puddle-jumping", incorporates two or more different puddle heights, with transitions between them. Motion on the higher energy puddles promotes barrier crossings, while motion on the lower puddles more efficiently samples the more important low potential energy regions. We test the method on conformational changes in a model of n-pentane, for which the potential energy parameters have been modified to exhibit a range of barrier heights. The method greatly increases the frequency of barrier crossings while minimizing the time spent sampling unimportant, high-energy regions of configuration space. It is flexible and can be applied to large systems whose features are not known in advance. Finally, it converges rigorously to the correct canonical ensemble distribution; options in its implementation affect only the rate of convergence, not the final converged result. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

 Nanostructured carbonaceous materials, that is, carbon materials with a feature size on the nanometer scale and, in some cases, functionalized surfaces, already play an important role in a wide range of emerging fields, such as the search for novel energy sources, efficient energy storage, sustainable chemical technology, as well as organic electronic materials. Furthermore, such materials might offer solutions to the challenges associated with the on-going depletion of nonrenewable energy resources or climate change, and they may promote further breakthroughs in the field of microelectronics. However, novel methods for their preparation will be required that afford functional carbon materials with controlled surface chemistry, mesoscopic morphology, and microstructure. A highly promising approach for the synthesis of such materials is based on the use of well-defined molecular precursors.

 Here we show scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM), non-contact atomic force microscopy (AFM) and inelastic electron tunnelling spectroscopy (IETS) measurements on organic molecule with a CO- terminated tip at 5K. The high-resolution contrast observed simultaneously in all channels unam- biguously demonstrates the common imaging mechanism in STM/AFM/IETS, related to the lateral bending of the CO-functionalized tip. The IETS spectroscopy reveals that the submolecular con- trast at 5K consists of both renormalization of vibrational frequency and variation of the amplitude of IETS signal. This finding is also corroborated by first principles simulations. We extend accord- ingly the probe-particle AFM/STM/IETS model to include these two main ingredients necessary to reproduce the high-resolution IETS contrast. We also employ the first principles simulations to get more insight into different response of frustrated translation and rotational modes of CO-tip during imaging.

@abstract:
 A method is described for the identification of similar “supramolecular constructs” (sub-components of complete crystal structures) of 0-, 1- or 2-dimensionality in different crystal structures of specific molecules (polymorphs) or crystal structures of similar molecules (families) and of 3-dimensionality in isostructural assemblies. A computer program, XPac, has been developed to enable a convenient application of the method, and procedures for the quantification of similarity relationships are proposed. The method is demonstrated and discussed on the basis of a number of case studies. It has been found that supramolecular constructs of different dimensionality are frequent and, therefore, likely to be important features in the consideration of nucleation, crystal growth and polymorphism.

@abstract:
 Identification of relevant reaction pathways in ever more complex composite materials and nanostructures poses a central challenge to computational materials discovery. Efficient global structure search, tailored to identify chemically relevant intermediates, could provide the necessary first-principles atomistic insight to enable a rational process design. In this work we modify a common feature of global geometry optimization schemes by employing automatically generated collective curvilinear coordinates. The similarity of these coordinates to molecular vibrations enhances the generation of chemically meaningful trial structures for covalently bound systems. In the application to hydrogenated Si clusters, we concomitantly observe a significantly increased efficiency in identifying low-energy structures and exploit it for an extensive sampling of potential products of silicon-cluster soft landing on Si(001) surfaces.

 Ways to characterize and control excited states at the single-molecule and atomic levels are needed to exploit excitation-triggered energy-conversion processes. Here, we present a single-molecule spectroscopic method with micro-electron volt energy and submolecular-spatial resolution using laser driving of nanocavity plasmons to induce molecular luminescence in scanning tunneling microscopy. This tunable and monochromatic nanoprobe allows state-selective characterization of the energy levels and linewidths of individual electronic and vibrational quantum states of a single molecule. Moreover, we demonstrate that the energy levels of the states can be finely tuned by using the Stark effect and plasmon-exciton coupling in the tunneling junction. Our technique and findings open a route to the creation of designed energy-converting functions by using tuned energy levels of molecular systems.

@abstract:
 Patterning with a focused ion beam (FIB) is an extremely versatile fabrication process that can be used to create microscale and nanoscale designs on the surface of practically any solid sample material. Based on the type of ion-sample interaction utilized, FIB-based manufacturing can be both subtractive and additive, even in the same processing step. Indeed, the capability of easily creating three-dimensional patterns and shaping objects by milling and deposition is probably the most recognized feature of ion beam lithography (IBL) and micromachining. However, there exist several other techniques, such as ion implantation- and ion damage-based patterning and surface functionalization types of processes that have emerged as valuable additions to the nanofabrication toolkit and that are less widely known. While fabrication throughput, in general, is arguably low due to the serial nature of the direct-writing process, speed is not necessarily a problem in these IBL applications that work with small ion doses. Here we provide a comprehensive review of ion beam lithography in general and a practical guide to the individual IBL techniques developed to date. Special attention is given to applications in nanofabrication.

 We present a systematic performance analysis of first-principles basin-hopping BH runs, with the target to identify all low-energy isomers of small Si and Cu clusters described within density-functional theory. As representative and widely employed move classes we focus on single-particle and collective moves, in which one or all atoms in the cluster at once are displaced in a random direction by some prescribed move distance, respectively. The analysis provides detailed insights into the bottlenecks and governing factors for the sampling efficiency, as well as simple rules of thumb for near-optimum move settings that are intriguingly independent of the distinctly different chemistry of Si and Cu. At corresponding settings, the observed performance of the BH algorithm employing two simple general-purpose move classes is already very good and for the small systems studied essentially limited by frequent revisits to a few dominant isomers.

This hampers the ongoing worldwide effort towards the integration of optoelectronics on silicon wafers. Even though silicon nanocrystals are much better light emitters, they retain the indirect-gap nature. Here, we propose a solution to this long-standing problem: silicon nanocrystals can be transformed into a material with fundamental direct bandgap via a concerted action of quantum confinement and tensile strain. We document this transformation by DFT calculations mapping the E(k) band-structure of Si nanocrystals. The experimental proofs are then given firstly by a 10 000× increase in the photon emission rate of strained silicon nanocrystals together with their altered absorbance spectra, both of which point to direct dipole-allowed transitions, secondly by single nanocrystal spectroscopy, confirming reduced phonon energies and thus the presence of tensile strain, and lastly by photoluminescence studies under external hydrostatic pressure.

@abstract:
 The Davidson method is a popular preconditioned variant of the Arnoldi method for solving large eigenvalue problems. For theoretical as well as practical reasons the two methods are often used with restarting. Frequently, information is saved through approximated eigenvectors to compensate for the convergence impairment caused by restarting. We call this scheme of retaining more eigenvectors than needed "thick restarting"and prove that thick restarted, nonpreconditioned Davidson is equivalent to implicitly restarted Arnoldi. We also establish a relation between thick restarted Davidson and a Davidson emthod applied on a deflated system. The theory is used to address the question of which and how many eigenvectors to retain and motivates the development of a dynamic thick restarting scheme for the symmetric case, which can be used in both Davidson and implicit restarted Arnoldi. Several experiments demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of the scheme.

@abstract:
 The development of a variety of nanoscale applications requires the fabrication and control of atomic or molecular switches that can be reversibly operated by light, a short-range force, electric current or other external stimuli. For such molecules to be used as electronic components, they should be directly coupled to a metallic support and the switching unit should be easily connected to other molecular species without suppressing switching performance. Here, we show that a free-base tetraphenyl-porphyrin molecule, which is anchored to a silver surface, can function as a molecular conductance switch. The saddle-shaped molecule has two hydrogen atoms in its inner cavity that can be flipped between two states with different local conductance levels using the electron current through the tip of a scanning tunnelling microscope. Moreover, by deliberately removing one of the hydrogens, a four-level conductance switch can be created. The resulting device, which could be controllably integrated into the surrounding nanoscale environment, relies on the transfer of a single proton and therefore contains the smallest possible atomistic switching unit.

@abstract:
 The Van Allen radiation belts contain ultrarelativistic electrons trapped in Earth's magnetic field. Since their discovery in 1958, a fundamental unanswered question has been how electrons can be accelerated to such high energies. Two classes of processes have been proposed: transport and acceleration of electrons from a source population located outside the radiation belts (radial acceleration) or acceleration of lower-energy electrons to relativistic energies in situ in the heart of the radiation belts (local acceleration). We report measurements from NASA's Van Allen Radiation Belt Storm Probes that clearly distinguish between the two types of acceleration. The observed radial profiles of phase space density are characteristic of local acceleration in the heart of the radiation belts and are inconsistent with a predominantly radial acceleration process.

@abstract:
 The beauty and utility of interlocked architectures have been making their way relentlessly into chemistry in the form of me- chanically interlocked molecules (MIMs) for almost half a cen- tury now. Few would challenge the assertion that the emer- gence of template-directed synthetic protocols has aided and abetted the facile and efficient construction of MIMs compared with the statistical approaches employed while the field was still in its infancy. To date, a panoply of MIMs has been created in the wake of emerging recognition motifs and the template- directed synthetic protocols they have forged. Among these motifs, those dependent on p–p stacking in the form of donor–acceptor interactions have played an important role in the increasingly rapid development of the field. The few integrated systems that have so far emerged based on this class of MIMs demonstrate their ability to act as active components in many potential applications. This review focuses on the progress which has been accomplished during the past decade involving MIMs comprising aromatic p–p stacking interactions. While progress has been remarkable, opportunities still abound for MIMs assembled by p–p recognition.

@abstract:
 Silicon nanocrystals are an extensively studied light-emitting material due to their inherent biocompatibility and compatibility with silicon-based technology. Although they might seem to fall behind their rival, namely, direct band gap based semiconductor nanocrystals, when it comes to the emission of light, room for improvement still lies in the exploitation of various surface passivations. In this paper, we report on an original way, taking place at room temperature and ambient pressure, to replace the silicon oxide shell of luminescent Si nanocrystals with capping involving organic residues. The modification of surface passivation is evidenced by both Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance measurements. In addition, single-nanocrystal spectroscopy reveals the occurrence of a systematic fine structure in the emission single spectra, which is connected with an intrinsic property of small nanocrystals since a very similar structure has recently been observed in specially passivated semiconductor CdZnSe nanoparticles. The organic capping also dramatically changes optical properties of Si nanocrystals (resulting ensemble photoluminescence quantum efficiency 20{\%}, does not deteriorate, radiative lifetime 10 ns at 550 nm at room temperature). Optically clear colloidal dispersion of these nanocrystals thus exhibits properties fully comparable with direct band gap semiconductor nanoparticles.

@abstract:
 Silk features exceptional mechanical properties such as high tensile strength and great extensibility, making it one of the toughest materials known. The exceptional strength of silkworm and spider silks, exceeding that of steel, arises from beta-sheet nanocrystals that universally consist of highly conserved poly-(Gly-Ala) and poly-Ala domains. This is counterintuitive because the key molecular interactions in beta-sheet nanocrystals are hydrogen bonds, one of the weakest chemical bonds known. Here we report a series of large-scale molecular dynamics simulations, revealing that beta-sheet nanocrystals confined to a few nanometres achieve higher stiffness, strength and mechanical toughness than larger nanocrystals. We illustrate that through nanoconfinement, a combination of uniform shear deformation that makes most efficient use of hydrogen bonds and the emergence of dissipative molecular stick-slip deformation leads to significantly enhanced mechanical properties. Our findings explain how size effects can be exploited to create bioinspired materials with superior mechanical properties in spite of relying on mechanically inferior, weak hydrogen bonds.

 One of the key challenges in chemistry is to break and form bonds selectively in complex organic molecules that possess a range of different functional groups. To do this at the single-molecule level not only provides an opportunity to create custom nanoscale devices, but offers opportunities for the in-depth study of how the molecular electronic structure changes in individual reactions. Here we use a scanning tunnelling microscope (STM) to induce a sequence of targeted bond dissociation and formation steps in single thiol-based $\pi$-conjugated molecules adsorbed on a NiAl(110) surface. Furthermore, the electronic resonances of the resulting species were measured by spatially resolved electronic spectroscopy at each reaction step. Specifically, the STM was used to cleave individual acetyl groups and to form Au-S bonds by manipulating single Au atoms. A detailed understanding of the Au-S bond and its non-local influence is fundamentally important for determining the electron transport in thiol-based molecular junction.

@abstract:
 Three-dimensional covalent organic frameworks (3D COFs) were synthesized by targeting two nets based on triangular and tetrahedral nodes: ctn and bor. The respective 3D COFs were synthesized as crystalline solids by condensation reactions of tetrahedral tetra(4-dihydroxyborylphenyl) methane or tetra(4-dihydroxyborylphenyl)silane and by co-condensation of triangular 2,3,6,7,10,11-hexahydroxytriphenylene. Because these materials are entirely constructed from strong covalent bonds (C-C, C-O, C-B, and B-O), they have high thermal stabilities (400 degrees to 500 degrees C), and they also have high surface areas (3472 and 4210 square meters per gram for COF-102 and COF-103, respectively) and extremely low densities (0.17 grams per cubic centimeter).

@abstract:
 Manipulation of individual atoms and molecules by scanning probe microscopy offers the ability of controlled assembly at the single-atom scale. However, the driving forces behind atomic manipulation have not yet been measured. We used an atomic force microscope to measure the vertical and lateral forces exerted on individual adsorbed atoms or molecules by the probe tip. We found that the force that it takes to move an atom depends strongly on the adsorbate and the surface. Our results indicate that for moving metal atoms on metal surfaces, the lateral force component plays the dominant role. Furthermore, measuring spatial maps of the forces during manipulation yielded the full potential energy landscape of the tip-sample interaction.

@abstract:
 Robust methods to tune the unique electronic properties of graphene by chemical modification are in great demand due to the potential of the two dimensional material to impact a range of device applications. Here we show that carbon and nitrogen core-level resonant X-ray spectroscopy is a sensitive probe of chemical bonding and electronic structure of chemical dopants introduced in single-sheet graphene films. In conjunction with density functional theory based calculations, we are able to obtain a detailed picture of bond types and electronic structure in graphene doped with nitrogen at the sub-percent level. We show that different N-bond types, including graphitic, pyridinic, and nitrilic, can exist in a single, dilutely N-doped graphene sheet. We show that these various bond types have profoundly different effects on the carrier concentration, indicating that control over the dopant bond type is a crucial requirement in advancing graphene electronics.

@title:    Theoretical modeling of plasmon-enhanced raman images of a single molecule with subnanometer resolution
@author:   Duan, Sai and Tian, Guangjun and Ji, Yongfei and Shao, Jiushu and Dong, Zhenchao and Luo, Yi
@doi:      10.1021/jacs.5b03741
@abstract:
 Under local plasmonic excitation, Raman images of single molecules can now surprisingly reach subnanometer resolution. However, its physical origin has not been fully understood. Here we report a quantum-mechanical description of the interaction between a molecule and a highly confined plasmonic field. We show that when the spatial distribution of the plasmonic field is comparable to the size of the molecule, the optical transition matrix of the molecule becomes dependent on the position and distribution of the plasmonic field, resulting in a spatially resolved high-resolution Raman image of the molecule. The resonant Raman image reflects the electronic transition density of the molecule. In combination with first-principles calculations, the simulated Raman image of a porphyrin derivative adsorbed on a silver surface nicely reproduces its experimental counterpart. The present theory provides the basic framework for describing linear and nonlinear responses of molecules under highly confined plasmonic fields.

@abstract:
 We analyze the optical gain of tensile-strained, n-type Ge material for Si-compatible laser applications. The band structure of unstrained Ge exhibits indirect conduction band valleys (L) lower than the direct valley (Gamma) by 136 meV. Adequate strain and n-type doping engineering can effectively provide population inversion in the direct bandgap of Ge. The tensile strain decreases the difference between the L valleys and the Gamma valley, while the extrinsic electrons from n-type doping fill the L valleys to the level of the Gamma valley to compensate for the remaining energy difference. Our modeling shows that with a combination of 0.25{\%} tensile strain and an extrinsic electron density of 7.6x10(19)/cm(3) by n-type doping, a net material gain of {\~{}}400 cm(-1) can be obtained from the direct gap transition of Ge despite of the free carrier absorption loss. The threshold current density for lasing is estimated to be {\~{}}6kA cm(-2) for a typical edgeemitting double heterojunction structure. These results indicate that tensile strained n-type Ge is a good candidate for Si integrated lasers.

@abstract:
 Free-standing paper-like or foil-like materials are an integral part of our technological society. Their uses include protective layers, chemical filters, components of electrical batteries or supercapacitors, adhesive layers, electronic or optoelectronic components, and molecular storage. Inorganic 'paper-like' materials based on nanoscale components such as exfoliated vermiculite or mica platelets have been intensively studied and commercialized as protective coatings, high-temperature binders, dielectric barriers and gas-impermeable membranes. Carbon-based flexible graphite foils composed of stacked platelets of expanded graphite have long been used in packing and gasketing applications because of their chemical resistivity against most media, superior sealability over a wide temperature range, and impermeability to fluids. The discovery of carbon nanotubes brought about bucky paper, which displays excellent mechanical and electrical properties that make it potentially suitable for fuel cell and structural composite applications. Here we report the preparation and characterization of graphene oxide paper, a free-standing carbon-based membrane material made by flow-directed assembly of individual graphene oxide sheets. This new material outperforms many other paper-like materials in stiffness and strength. Its combination of macroscopic flexibility and stiffness is a result of a unique interlocking-tile arrangement of the nanoscale graphene oxide sheets.

@abstract:
 New scaling parameters are presented for use in the spin-component scaled (SCS) variant of density fitted local second-order Moller-Plesset perturbation theory (DF-LMP2) that have been optimized for use in evaluating the interaction energy between nucleic acid base pairs. The optimal set of parameters completely neglects the contribution from antiparallel-spin electron pairs to the MP2 energy while scaling the parallel contribution by 1.76. These spin-component scaled for nucleobases (SCSN) parameters are obtained by minimizing, with respect to SCS parameters, the rms interaction energy error relative to the best available literature values, over a set of ten stacked nucleic acid base pairs. The applicability of this scaling to a wide variety of noncovalent interactions is verified through evaluation of a larger set of model complexes, including those dominated by dispersion and electrostatics. {\textcopyright} 2007 American Chemical Society.

@abstract:
 The origin of so-called "subatomic" resolution in dynamic force microscopy has remained controversial since its first observation in 2000. A number of detailed experimental and theoretical studies have identified different possible physicochemical mechanisms potentially giving rise to subatomic contrast. In this study, for the first time we are able to assign the origin of a specific instance of subatomic contrast as being due to the back bonding of a surface atom in the tip-sample junction.

@abstract:
 Materials exhibiting a spontaneous electrical polarization that can be switched easily between antiparallel orientations are of potential value for sensors, photonics and energy-efficient memories. In this context, organic ferroelectrics are of particular interest because they promise to be lightweight, inexpensive and easily processed into devices. A recently identified family of organic ferroelectric structures is based on intermolecular charge transfer, where donor and acceptor molecules co-crystallize in an alternating fashion known as a mixed stack: in the crystalline lattice, a collective transfer of electrons from donor to acceptor molecules results in the formation of dipoles that can be realigned by an external field as molecules switch partners in the mixed stack. Although mixed stacks have been investigated extensively, only three systems are known to show ferroelectric switching, all below 71 kelvin. Here we describe supramolecular charge-transfer networks that undergo ferroelectric polarization switching with a ferroelectric Curie temperature above room temperature. These polar and switchable systems utilize a structural synergy between a hydrogen-bonded network and charge-transfer complexation of donor and acceptor molecules in a mixed stack. This supramolecular motif could help guide the development of other functional organic systems that can switch polarization under the influence of electric fields at ambient temperatures.

@abstract:
 We report a straightforward method to produce high-quality nitrogen-doped graphene on SiC(0001) using direct nitrogen ion implantation and subsequent stabilization at temperatures above 1300 K. We demonstrate that double defects, which comprise two nitrogen defects in a second-nearest-neighbor (meta) configuration, can be formed in a controlled way by adjusting the duration of bombardment. Two types of atomic contrast of single N defects are identified in scanning tunneling microscopy. We attribute the origin of these two contrasts to different tip structures by means of STM simulations. The characteristic dip observed over N defects is explained in terms of the destructive quantum interference.

@abstract:
 One of the greatest shortcomings of macromolecular energy minimization and molecular dynamics techniques is that they generally do not preserve the native structure of proteins as observed by x-ray crystallography. This deformation of the native structure means that these methods are not generally used to refine structures produced by homology-modeling techniques. Here, we use a database of 75 proteins to test the ability of a variety of popular molecular mechanics force fields to maintain the native structure. Minimization from the native structure is a weak test of potential energy functions: It is complemented by a much stronger test in which the same methods are compared for their ability to attract a near-native decoy protein structure toward the native structure. We use a powerfully convergent energy-minimization method and show that, of the traditional molecular mechanics potentials tested, only one showed a modest net improvement over a large data set of structurally diverse proteins. A smooth, differentiable knowledge-based pairwise atomic potential performs better on this test than traditional potential functions. This work is expected to have important implications for protein structure refinement, homology modeling, and structure prediction.

@abstract:
 The use of scanning probe microscopy-based techniques to manipulate single molecules and deliver them in a precisely controlled manner to a specific target represents a significant nanotechnological challenge. The ultimate physical limit in the design and fabrication of organic surfaces can be reached using this approach. Here we show that the atomic force microscope (AFM), which has been used extensively to investigate the stretching of individual molecules, can deliver and immobilize single molecules, one at a time, on a surface. Reactive polymer molecules, attached at one end to an AFM tip, are brought into contact with a modified silicon substrate to which they become linked by a chemical reaction. When the AFM tip is pulled away from the surface, the resulting mechanical force causes the weakest bond - the one between the tip and polymer - to break. This process transfers the polymer molecule to the substrate where it can be modified by further chemical reactions.

 We show how the success of deep learning could depend not only on mathematics but also on physics: although well-known mathematical theorems guarantee that neural networks can approximate arbitrary functions well, the class of functions of practical interest can frequently be approximated through "cheap learning" with exponentially fewer parameters than generic ones. We explore how properties frequently encountered in physics such as symmetry, locality, compositionality, and polynomial log-probability translate into exceptionally simple neural networks. We further argue that when the statistical process generating the data is of a certain hierarchical form prevalent in physics and machine-learning, a deep neural network can be more efficient than a shallow one. We formalize these claims using information theory and discuss the relation to the renormalization group. We prove various "no-flattening theorems" showing when efficient linear deep networks cannot be accurately approximated by shallow ones without efficiency loss, for example, we show that {\$}n{\$} variables cannot be multiplied using fewer than 2{\^{}}n neurons in a single hidden layer.

@abstract:
 Intramolecular charge transfer processes play an important role in many biological, chemical and physical processes including photosynthesis, redox chemical reactions and electron transfer in molecular electronics. These charge transfer processes are frequently influenced by the dynamics of their molecular or atomic environments, and they are accompanied with energy dissipation into this environment. The detailed understanding of such processes is fundamental for their control and possible exploitation in future technological applications. Most of the experimental studies of the intramolecular charge transfer processes so far have been carried out using time-resolved optical spectroscopies on large molecular ensembles. This hampers detailed understanding of the charge transfer on the single molecular level. Here we build upon the recent progress in scanning probe microscopy, and demonstrate the control of mixed valence state. We report observation of single electron transfer between two ferrocene redox centers within a single molecule and the detection of energy dissipation associated with the single electron transfer.

 Charge distribution on surfaces and molecules plays an important role in many physical and chemical processes including catalytic reactions, adsorption, adhesion and charge transport. However, detailed mapping of the spatial charge distribution on atomic scale still remains a challenge, despite recent advances in the field of scanning probe microscopy. Consequently, we are witnessing extensive activity in search for a reliable and robust protocol to image the charge distribution. In this chapter, we will discuss different methods which provide information about charge distribution at atomic or submolecular scale, including Kelvin probe force microscopy, scanning quantum dot microscopy or high-resolution imaging with functionalized tips. We will briefly discuss the mechanism of each of the different methods as well as their advantages and drawbacks.

@abstract:
 Efficient structure search is a major challenge in computational materials science. We present a modification of the basin hopping global geometry optimization approach that uses a curvilinear coordinate system to describe global trial moves. This approach has recently been shown to be efficient in structure determination of clusters [Nano Letters 15, 8044-8048 (2015)] and is here extended for its application to covalent, complex molecules and large adsorbates on surfaces. The employed, automatically constructed delocalized internal coordinates are similar to molecular vibrations, which enhances the generation of chemically meaningful trial structures. By introducing flexible constraints and local translation and rotation of independent geometrical subunits we enable the use of this method for molecules adsorbed on surfaces and interfaces. For two test systems, trans-{\$}\backslashbeta{\$}-ionylideneacetic acid adsorbed on a Au(111) surface and methane adsorbed on a Ag(111) surface, we obtain superior performance of the method compared to standard optimization moves based on Cartesian coordinates.

@abstract:
 The discovery of new materials can bring enormous societal and technological progress. In this context, exploring completely the large space of potential materials is computationally intractable. Here, we review methods for achieving inverse design, which aims to discover tailored materials from the starting point of a particular desired functionality. Recent advances from the rapidly growing field of artificial intelligence, mostly from the subfield of machine learning, have resulted in a fertile exchange of ideas, where approaches to inverse molecular design are being proposed and employed at a rapid pace. Among these, deep generative models have been applied to numerous classes of materials: rational design of prospective drugs, synthetic routes to organic compounds, and optimization of photovoltaics and redox flow batteries, as well as a variety of other solid-state materials.

@abstract:
 We show how the success of deep learning depends not only on mathematics but also on physics: although well-known mathematical theorems guarantee that neural networks can approximate arbitrary functions well, the class of functions of practical interest can be approximated through "cheap learning" with exponentially fewer parameters than generic ones, because they have simplifying properties tracing back to the laws of physics. The exceptional simplicity of physics-based functions hinges on properties such as symmetry, locality, compositionality and polynomial log-probability, and we explore how these properties translate into exceptionally simple neural networks approximating both natural phenomena such as images and abstract representations thereof such as drawings. We further argue that when the statistical process generating the data is of a certain hierarchical form prevalent in physics and machine-learning, a deep neural network can be more efficient than a shallow one. We formalize these claims using information theory and discuss the relation to renormalization group procedures. Various "no-flattening theorems" show when these efficient deep networks cannot be accurately approximated by shallow ones without efficiency loss - even for linear networks.

 The large-scale synthesis of high-quality thin films with extensive tunability derived from molecular building blocks will advance the development of artificial solids with designed functionalities. We report the synthesis of two-dimensional (2D) porphyrin polymer films with wafer-scale homogeneity in the ultimate limit of monolayer thickness by growing films at a sharp pentane/water interface, which allows the fabrication of their hybrid superlattices. Laminar assembly polymerization of porphyrin monomers could form monolayers of metal-organic frameworks with Cu 2+ linkers or covalent organic frameworks with terephthalaldehyde linkers. Both the lattice structures and optical properties of these 2D films were directly controlled by the molecular monomers and polymerization chemistries. The 2D polymers were used to fabricate arrays of hybrid superlattices with molybdenum disulfide that could be used in electrical capacitors.

@author:   Cash, J. R. and Karp, Alan H.
@doi:      10.1145/79505.79507
@abstract:
 High-order Runge-Kutta methods require more function evaluations per integration step than, for example, Adams methods used in PECE mode, and so, with RKMs, it is especially important to avoid rejected steps. Steps are often rejected when certain derivatives of the solution are very large for part of the region of integration. This corresponds, for example, to regions where the solution has a sharp front or, in the limit, some derivative of the solution is discontinuous. In these circumstances the assumption that the local truncation error is changing slowly is invalid, and so any step-choosing algorithm is likely to produce an unacceptable step. In this paper we derive a family of explicit Runge-Kutta formulas. Each formula is very efficient for problems with smooth solutions as well as problems having rapidly varying solutions. Each member of this family consists of a fifth-order formula that contains imbedded formulas of all orders 1 through 4. By computing solutions at several different orders, it is possible to detect sharp fronts or discontinuities before all the function evaluations defining the full Runge-Kutta step have been computed. We can then either accept a lower order solution or abort the step, depending on which course of action seems appropriate. The efficiency of the new algorithm is demonstrated on the DETEST test set as well as on some difficult test problems with sharp fronts or discontinuities.

@abstract:
 Vibrational spectra for a single molecule adsorbed on a solid surface have been obtained with a scanning tunneling microscope (STM). Inelastic electron tunneling spectra for an isolated acetylene (C2H2) molecule adsorbed on the copper (100) surface showed an increase in the tunneling conductance at 358 millivolts, resulting from excitation of the C-H stretch mode. An isotopic shift to 266 millivolts was observed for deuterated acetylene (C2D2). Vibrational microscopy from spatial imaging of the inelastic tunneling channels yielded additional data to further distinguish and characterize the two isotopes. Single-molecule vibrational analysis should lead to better understanding and control of surface chemistry at the atomic level.

 We present new developments of the evolutionary algorithm USPEX for crystal structure prediction and its adaptation to cluster structure prediction.

These and other developments substantially improve the efficiency of the algorithm and allow reliable prediction of structures with up to ???200 atoms in the unit cell. We show that an advanced version of the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) can be created on the basis of our method, but PSO is strongly outperformed by USPEX. We also show how ideas from metadynamics can be used in the context of evolutionary structure prediction for escaping from local minima. Our cluster structure prediction algorithm, using the ideas initially developed for crystals, also shows excellent performance and outperforms other state-of-the-art algorithms. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.

@abstract:
 The Density-Functional Tight Binding (DFTB) method is a popular semiempirical approximation to Density Functional Theory (DFT). In many cases, DFTB can provide comparable accuracy to DFT at a fraction of the cost, enabling simulations on length and time scales that are unfeasible with first-principles DFT. At the same time (and in contrast to empirical interatomic potentials and force fields), DFTB still offers direct access to electronic properties such as the band structure. These advantages come at the cost of introducing empirical parameters to the method, leading to a reduced transferability compared to true first-principle approaches. Consequently, it would be very useful if the parameter sets could be routinely adjusted for a given project. While fairly robust and transferable parametrization workflows exist for the electronic structure part of DFTB, the so-called repulsive potential Vrep poses a major challenge. In this paper, we propose a machine-learning (ML) approach to fitting Vrep, using Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) to reconstruct Vrep with DFT-DFTB force residues as training data. The use of GPR circumvents the need for nonlinear or global parameter optimization, while at the same time offering arbitrary flexibility in terms of the functional form. We also show that the proposed method can be applied to multiple elements at once, by fitting repulsive potentials for organic molecules containing carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. Overall, the new approach removes focus from the choice of functional form and parametrization procedure, in favor of a data-driven philosophy.

 In supernova cores, nuclear “pasta” phases such as a triangular lattice of rodlike nuclei and layered structure of slablike nuclei are considered to exist. However, it is still unclear whether or not they are actually formed in collapsing supernova cores. Using ab initio simulations called quantum molecular dynamics, here we solve this problem by demonstrating that a lattice of rodlike nuclei is formed from a bcc lattice by compression. We also find that, in the transition process, the system undergoes a zigzag configuration of elongated nuclei, which are formed by a fusion of two original spherical nuclei.

Recently, such an approach has been used to produce isolable amounts of the fullerene C(60) from commercially available starting materials. But the overall process required 11 steps to generate a suitable polycyclic aromatic precursor molecule, which was then dehydrogenated in the gas phase with a yield of only about one per cent. Here we report the formation of C(60) and the triazafullerene C(57)N(3) from aromatic precursors using a highly efficient surface-catalysed cyclodehydrogenation process. We find that after deposition onto a platinum (111) surface and heating to 750 K, the precursors are transformed into the corresponding fullerene and triazafullerene molecules with about 100 per cent yield. We expect that this approach will allow the production of a range of other fullerenes and heterofullerenes, once suitable precursors are available. Also, if the process is carried out in an atmosphere containing guest species, it might even allow the encapsulation of atoms or small molecules to form endohedral fullerenes.

@abstract:
 Water/solid interfaces are vital to our daily lives and are also a central theme across an incredibly wide range of scientific disciplines. Resolving the internal structure, that is, the O-H directionality, of water molecules adsorbed on solid surfaces has been one of the key issues of water science yet it remains challenging. Using a low-temperature scanning tunnelling microscope, we report submolecular-resolution imaging of individual water monomers and tetramers on NaCl(001) films supported by a Au(111) substrate at 5 K. The frontier molecular orbitals of adsorbed water were directly visualized, which allowed discrimination of the orientation of the monomers and the hydrogen-bond directionality of the tetramers in real space. Comparison with ab initio density functional theory calculations reveals that the ability to access the orbital structures of water stems from the electronic decoupling effect provided by the NaCl films and the precisely tunable tip-water coupling.

 Ultralight ({\textless}10 milligrams per cubic centimeter) cellular materials are desirable for thermal insulation; battery electrodes; catalyst supports; and acoustic, vibration, or shock energy damping. We present ultralight materials based on periodic hollow-tube microlattices. These materials are fabricated by starting with a template formed by self-propagating photopolymer waveguide prototyping, coating the template by electroless nickel plating, and subsequently etching away the template. The resulting metallic microlattices exhibit densities $\rho$ ≥ 0.9 milligram per cubic centimeter, complete recovery after compression exceeding 50{\%} strain, and energy absorption similar to elastomers. Young's modulus E scales with density as E {\~{}} $\rho$(2), in contrast to the E {\~{}} $\rho$(3) scaling observed for ultralight aerogels and carbon nanotube foams with stochastic architecture. We attribute these properties to structural hierarchy at the nanometer, micrometer, and millimeter scales.

@abstract:
 Knowledge about tautomer forms of a structure is important since, e.g., a property prediction for a molecule can yield to different results which depend on the individual tautomer. Tautomers are isomers that can be transformed to each other through chemical equilibrium reactions. In this paper the first exact Branch-and-Bound (B{\&}B) algorithm to calculate tautomer structures is proposed. The algorithm is complete in the sense of tautomerism and generates all possible tautomers of a structure according to the tautomer definition, it is initialized with. To be efficient, the algorithm takes advantage of symmetric and formation properties. Some restrictions are used to enable an early pruning of some branches of the B{\&}B tree. This is important, since a simple enumeration strategy would lead to number of candidate tautomers that is exponentially increasing with the number of hydrogen atoms and their attachment sites. The proposed implementation of the B{\&}B algorithm covers the majority of the prototropic tautomer cases, but can be adapted to other kinds of tautomerism too. Furthermore, a computer processable definition of tautomerism is given in the form of the moving hydrogen atom problem.

@abstract:
 The controlled positioning and assembly of functional molecules into ordered nanostructures on surfaces depends on the interplay of multiple interactions on different strength and length scales. On metal surfaces, the relatively strong molecule-substrate interactions can constrain the molecules to adsorb in registry with the surface periodicity and lock them into specific adsorption sites. This can significantly reduce the structural tunability of the molecular nanostructure arrays formed. Inert graphite has a smooth potential-energy surface as well as relatively weak interfacial interactions with adsorbed molecules, and is therefore chosen as a supporting substrate for constructing molecular nanostructures with a high degree of controllability and tunability. The aim of this article is to highlight recent progress in the fabrication of self-assembled molecular nanostructures on inert graphite surfaces in ultra-high vacuum, with particular emphasis on the role of intermolecular interactions in the self-assembly process. We describe the formation of tunable two-dimensional (2D) binary molecular networks by directional and selective hydrogen bonding, as well as the templating effect of these 2D molecular networks, demonstrating the rational design and construction of long-range ordered 2D molecular nanostructures with desired functionality.

@abstract:
 Density functional theory (DFT) has become more successful at introducing dispersion interactions, and can be thus applied to a wide range of systems. Amongst these are systems that contain hydrogen bonds, which are extremely important for the biological regime. Here, the description of hydrogen-bonded interactions by DFT with and without dispersion corrections is investigated. For small complexes, for which electrostatics are the determining factor in the intermolecular interactions, the inclusion of dispersion with most functionals yields large errors. Only for larger systems, in which van der Waals interactions are more important, do dispersion corrections improve the performance of DFT for hydrogen-bonded systems. None of the studied functionals, including double hybrid functionals (with the exception of DSD-PBEP86 without dispersion corrections), are more accurate than MP2 for the investigated species.

@abstract:
 Molecular machine learning has been maturing rapidly over the last few years. Improved methods and the presence of larger datasets have enabled machine learning algorithms to make increasingly accurate predictions about molecular properties. However, algorithmic progress has been limited due to the lack of a standard benchmark to compare the efficacy of proposed methods; most new algorithms are benchmarked on different datasets making it challenging to gauge the quality of proposed methods. This work introduces MoleculeNet, a large scale benchmark for molecular machine learning. MoleculeNet curates multiple public datasets, establishes metrics for evaluation, and offers high quality open-source implementations of multiple previously proposed molecular featurization and learning algorithms (released as part of the DeepChem open source library). MoleculeNet benchmarks demonstrate that learnable representations are powerful tools for molecular machine learning and broadly offer the best performance. However, this result comes with caveats. Learnable representations still struggle to deal with complex tasks under data scarcity and highly imbalanced classification. For quantum mechanical and biophysical datasets, the use of physics-aware featurizations can be more important than choice of particular learning algorithm.

@abstract:
 A high-$\beta$ spheromak reactor concept has been formulated with an estimated overnight capital cost that is competitive with conventional power sources. This reactor concept utilizes recently discovered imposed-dynamo current drive (IDCD) and a molten salt (FLiBe) blanket system for first wall cooling, neutron moderation and tritium breeding. Currently available materials and ITER-developed cryogenic pumping systems were implemented in this concept from the basis of technological feasibility. A tritium breeding ratio (TBR) of greater than 1.1 has been calculated using a Monte Carlo N-Particle (MCNP5) neutron transport simulation. High temperature superconducting tapes (YBCO) were used for the equilibrium coil set, substantially reducing the recirculating power fraction when compared to previous spheromak reactor studies. Using zirconium hydride for neutron shielding, a limiting equilibrium coil lifetime of at least thirty full-power years has been achieved. The primary FLiBe loop was coupled to a supercritical carbon dioxide Brayton cycle due to attractive economics and high thermal efficiencies. With these advancements, an electrical output of 1000 MW from a thermal output of 2486 MW was achieved, yielding an overall plant efficiency of approximately 40{\%}. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.

@abstract:
 Ambitions to reach atomic resolution with light have been a major force in shaping nano-optics, whereby a central challenge is achieving highly localized optical fields. A promising approach employs plasmonic nanoantennas, but fluorescence quenching in the vicinity of metallic structures often imposes a strict limit on the attainable spatial resolution, and previous studies have reached only 8 nm resolution in fluorescence mapping. Here, we demonstrate spatially and spectrally resolved photoluminescence imaging of a single phthalocyanine molecule coupled to nanocavity plasmons in a tunnelling junction with a spatial resolution down to ∼8 {\AA} and locally map the molecular exciton energy and linewidth at sub-molecular resolution. This remarkable resolution is achieved through an exquisite nanocavity control, including tip-apex engineering with an atomistic protrusion, quenching management through emitter–metal decoupling and sub-nanometre positioning precision. Our findings provide new routes to optical imaging, spectroscopy and engineering of light–matter interactions at sub-nanometre scales.

@abstract:
 Tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS) of a single molecule is commonly described by considering the change in the polarizability of the molecule with respect to a normal coordinate induced by homogeneous illumination. However, the local fields induced by nanoscale and atomic-scale features at the surface of metallic clusters and nanogaps show strong inhomogeneities in their spatial distribution, which induces breaking of Raman selection rules. In this context, the spatial extension of the molecular electronic states subjected to strongly varying local fields challenges the validity of the point–dipole approximation as an adequate description of TERS in such configurations. Here, we introduce a general treatment to simulate single-molecule TERS spectra and their energy-filtered vibrational fingerprints maps, in which the polarization properties of the single molecule and that of the optical enhancing nanoresonator can be calculated separately and then conveniently combined to obtain the total Raman cross section of the molecule under the strongly inhomogeneous field. We apply the general method to study tip-enhanced scanning Raman picoscopy of a 4,4′-bipyridine and biphenyl molecules in the proximity of a silver icosahedral cluster with a few atoms at the tip apex mimicking an enhancing picocavity. The polarization of the molecules is calculated within density functional theory (DFT), and the optical response of the tip is calculated within a classical atomistic discrete–dipole approximation. The Raman spectra are found to be extremely sensitive to the spatial distribution of the local fields and to the orientation of the molecule. Our calculations show that the spatial mapping of molecular vibrational fingerprints, as probed by a tip with atomic protrusions, is capable to reveal intramolecular features of a single molecule in real space and thus establish a robust basis for scanning Raman picoscopy.

@abstract:
 In 1961, Rolf Landauer argued that the erasure of information is a dissipative process. A minimal quantity of heat, proportional to the thermal energy and called the Landauer bound, is necessarily produced when a classical bit of information is deleted. A direct consequence of this logically irreversible transformation is that the entropy of the environment increases by a finite amount. Despite its fundamental importance for information theory and computer science, the erasure principle has not been verified experimentally so far, the main obstacle being the difficulty of doing single-particle experiments in the low-dissipation regime. Here we experimentally show the existence of the Landauer bound in a generic model of a one-bit memory. Using a system of a single colloidal particle trapped in a modulated double-well potential, we establish that the mean dissipated heat saturates at the Landauer bound in the limit of long erasure cycles. This result demonstrates the intimate link between information theory and thermodynamics. It further highlights the ultimate physical limit of irreversible computation.

@abstract:
 Single-molecule junctions are elementary building blocks in novel electronics devices, and therefore, it is essential to understand the charge transport mechanisms at the single-molecular level. According to recent studies, the linker atoms connecting the organic molecule with the electrodes play a crucial role in optimizing the transport properties as well as thermodynamical stability of a molecular junction. We address this issue by considering N, O, S, and Se atoms as prospective linkers anchoring the benzene molecule to the Au(1 0 0) electrodes. Calculations based on non-equilibrium Green's function approach are performed within the framework of the density functional theory. Electron transport is studied in detail by analyzing the transmission spectra, density-of-states distributions, and current-voltage characteristics. Results show that the choice of linkers strongly affects the conductance of the junctions under study: at low bias regime, the current through N-linked molecules is remarkably higher as compared to the case of S and Se linkers, whereas the thermodynamical stability is similar. This offers an additional means of modifying the current-voltage characteristics of benzene-based molecular junctions by an appropriate selection of linkers.

@abstract:
 The fabrication methods of the microelectronics industry have been refined to produce ever smaller devices, but will soon reach their fundamental limits. A promising alternative route to even smaller functional systems with nanometre dimensions is the autonomous ordering and assembly of atoms and molecules on atomically well-defined surfaces. This approach combines ease of fabrication with exquisite control over the shape, composition and mesoscale organization of the surface structures formed. Once the mechanisms controlling the self-ordering phenomena are fully understood, the self-assembly and growth processes can be steered to create a wide range of surface nanostructures from metallic, semiconducting and molecular materials.

@abstract:
 Porphyrins and other tetrapyrrole macrocycles possess an impressive variety of functional properties that have been exploited in natural and artificial systems. Different metal centres incorporated within the tetradentate ligand are key for achieving and regulating vital processes, including reversible axial ligation of adducts, electron transfer, light-harvesting and catalytic transformations. Tailored substituents optimize their performance, dictating their arrangement in specific environments and mediating the assembly of molecular nanoarchitectures. Here we review the current understanding of these species at well-defined interfaces, disclosing exquisite insights into their structural and chemical properties, and also discussing methods by which to manipulate their intramolecular and organizational features. The distinct characteristics arising from the interfacial confinement offer intriguing prospects for molecular science and advanced materials. We assess the role of surface interactions with respect to electronic and physicochemical characteristics, and describe in situ metallation pathways, molecular magnetism, rotation and switching. The engineering of nanostructures, organized layers, interfacial hybrid and bio-inspired systems is also addressed.

@abstract:
 Much of molecular electronics involves trying to use molecules as (a) wires, (b) diodes or (c) field-effect transistors. In each case the criterion for determining good performance is well known: for wires it is conductance, for diodes it is conductance asymmetry, while for transistors it is high transconductance. Candidate molecules can be screened in terms of these criteria by calculating molecular conductivity in forward and reverse directions, and in the presence of a gating field. Hence so much theoretical work has focused on understanding molecular conductance. In contrast a molecule used as a quantum-dot cellular automata (QCA) cell conducts no current at all. The keys to QCA functionality are (a) charge localization, (b) bistable charge switching within the cell and (c) electric field coupling between one molecular cell and its neighbor. The combination of these effects can be examined using the cell-cell response function which relates the polarization of one cell to the induced polarization of a neighboring cell. The response function can be obtained by calculating the molecular electronic structure with ab initio quantum chemistry techniques. We present an analysis of molecular QCA performance that can be applied to any candidate molecule. From the full quantum chemistry, all-electron ab initio calculations we extract parameters for a reduced-state model which reproduces the cell-cell response function very well. Techniques from electron transfer theory are used to derive analytical models of the response function and can be employed on molecules too large for full ab initio treatment. A metric is derived which characterizes molecular QCA performance the way transconductance characterizes transistor performance. This metric can be assessed from absorption measurements of the electron transfer band or quantum chemistry calculations of appropriate sophistication.

@abstract:
 Last year, at least 30,000 scientific papers used the Kohn-Sham scheme of density functional theory to solve electronic structure problems in a wide variety of scientific fields. Machine learning holds the promise of learning the energy functional via examples, bypassing the need to solve the Kohn-Sham equations. This should yield substantial savings in computer time, allowing larger systems and/or longer time-scales to be tackled, but attempts to machine-learn this functional have been limited by the need to find its derivative. The present work overcomes this difficulty by directly learning the density-potential and energy-density maps for test systems and various molecules. We perform the first molecular dynamics simulation with a machine-learned density functional on malonaldehyde and are able to capture the intramolecular proton transfer process. Learning density models now allows the construction of accurate density functionals for realistic molecular systems.

@author:   Trefethen, Lloyd N.
@doi:      10.1137/060659831
@abstract:
 We consider the question of whether Gauss quadrature, which is very famous, is more powerful than the much simpler Clenshaw-Curtis quadrature, which is less well-known. Seven-line MATLAB codes are presented that implement both methods, and experiments show that the supposed factor-of-2 advantage of Gauss quadrature is rarely realized. Theorems are given to explain this effect. First, following Elliott and O'Hara and Smith in the 1960s, the phenomenon is explained as a consequence of aliasing of coefficients in Chebyshev expansions. Then another explanation is offered based on the interpretation of a quadrature formula as a rational approximation of {\$}\backslashlog((z+1)/(z-1)){\$} in the complex plane. Gauss quadrature corresponds to Pad$\backslash$'e approximation at {\$}z=\backslashinfty{\$}. Clenshaw-Curtis quadrature corresponds to an approximation whose order of accuracy at {\$}z=\backslashinfty{\$} is only half as high, but which is nevertheless equally accurate near {\$}[-1,1]{\$}.

@abstract:
 Energy captured directly from sunlight provides an attractive approach towards fulfilling the need for green energy resources on the terawatt scale with minimal environmental impact. Collecting and storing solar energy into fuel through photocatalyzed water splitting to generate hydrogen in a cost-effective way is desirable. To achieve this goal, low cost and environmentally benign urea was used to synthesize the metal-free photocatalyst graphitic carbon nitride (g-C₃N₄). A porous structure is achieved via one-step polymerization of the single precursor. The porous structure with increased BET surface area and pore volume shows a much higher hydrogen production rate under simulated sunlight irradiation than thiourea-derived and dicyanamide-derived g-C₃N₄. The presence of an oxygen atom is presumed to play a key role in adjusting the textural properties. Further improvement of the photocatalytic function can be expected with after-treatment due to its rich chemistry in functionalization.

 Gabedit is a freeware graphical user interface, offering preprocessing and postprocessing adapted (to date) to nine computational chemistry software packages. It includes tools for editing, displaying, analyzing, convert- ing, and animating molecular systems. A conformational search tool is implemented using a molecular mechanics or a semiempirical potential. Input files can be generated for the computational chemistry software supported by Gabe- dit. Some molecular properties of interest are processed directly from the output of the computational chemistry pro- grams; others are calculated by Gabedit before display. Molecular orbitals, electron density, electrostatic potential, nuclear magnetic resonance shielding density, and any other volumetric data properties can be displayed. It can dis- play electronic circular dichroism, UV–visible, infrared, and Raman-computed spectra after a convolution. Gabedit can generate a Povray file for geometry, surfaces, contours, and color-coded planes. Output can be exported to a selection of popular image and vector graphics file formats; the program can also generate a series of pictures for animation. Quantum mechanical electrostatic potentials can be calculated using the partial charges on atoms, or by solving the Poisson equation using the multigrid method. The atoms in molecule charges can also be calculated. Gabedit is platform independent. The code is distributed under free open source X11 style license and is available at http://gabedit.sourceforge.net/.

 We investigate multiterminal quantum transport through single monocyclic aromatic annulene molecules, and their derivatives, using the nonequilibrium Green function approach within the self-consistent Hartree-Fock approximation. We propose a new device concept, the quantum interference effect transistor, that exploits perfect destructive interference stemming from molecular symmetry and controls current flow by introducing decoherence and/or elastic scattering that break the symmetry. This approach overcomes the fundamental problems of power dissipation and environmental sensitivity that beset nanoscale device proposals.

@abstract:
 Electron transfer through molecules is an ubiquitous process underlying the function of biological systems and synthetic devices. The electronic coupling between components varies with the structure of the molecular bridge, often in classically unintuitive ways, as determined by its quantum electronic structure. Considerable efforts in electron-transfer theory have yielded models that are useful conceptually and provide quantitative means to understand transfer rates in terms of local contributions. Here we show how a description of the local currents within a bridging molecule bound to metallic electrodes can provide chemical insight into current flow. In particular, we show that through-space, as opposed to through-bond, terms dominate in a surprising number of instances, and that interference effects can be characterized by the reversal of ring currents. Together these ideas have implications for the design of molecular electronic devices, in particular for the ways in which substituent effects may be used for maximum impact.

@abstract:
 Aiming for highly efficient blue electroluminesence, we have designed and synthesized a novel class of tetraphenylimidazol-based excited-state intramolecular proton-transfer (ESIPT) molecules with covalently linked charge-transporting functional groups (carbazole- and oxadiazole- functionalized hydroxyl-substituted tetraphenylimidazole (HPI), i.e., HPI-Cbz and HPI-Oxd, respectively). High T-g (ca. 130 degrees C) amorphous films of HPI-Cbz and HPI-Oxd showed and ideal blue-light emission (lambda(max)=462 and 468 nm, Phi(PL) = 0.48 and 0.38) with a large Stokes shift of over 160 nm and a narrow full width at half-maximum of less than 65 nm. Organic light-emitting devices using HPI-Cbz and HPI-Oxd as the emitting layer generated an efficient blue electroluminescence (EL) emission peaking at around 460 nm with excellent CIE coordinates of (x, y) = (0.15, 0.1). A maximum external quantum efficiency of 2.94{\%} and a maximum brightness of 1 229 cd m(-2) at 100 mA cm(-2), as well as a low turn-on voltage of 48.4 V were achieved in this work.

Our present capabilities of manipulation and imaging of molecules by AFM approach the level of control predicted by Richard P. Feynman in his famous lecture There's plenty of room at the bottom', in which he described how molecules and materials might be formed by attaching and detaching individual atoms at will.

@abstract:
 A technique for empirical optimisation is presented in which a sequence of experimental designs each in the form of a regular or irregular simplex is used, each simplex having all vertices but one in common with the preceding simplex, and being completed by one new point. Reasons for the choice of design are outlined, and a formal procedure given. The performance of the technique in the presence and absence of error is studied and it is shown (a) that in the presence of error the rate of advance is inversely proportional to the error standard deviation, so that replication of observations is not beneficial, and (b) that the "efficiency" of the technique appears to increase in direct proportion to the number of factors investigated. It is also noted that, since the direction of movement from each simplex is dependent solely on the ranking of the observations, the technique may be used even in circumstances when a response cannot be quantitatively assessed. Attention is drawn to the ease with which second-order designs having the minimum number of experimental points may be derived from a regular simplex, and a fitting procedure which avoids a direct matrix inversion is suggested. In a brief appendix one or two new rotatable designs derivable from a simplex are noted.

 Nature offers a huge and only partially explored variety of small molecules with potential pharmaceutical applications. Commonly used characterization methods for natural products include spectroscopic techniques such as nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. In some cases, however, these techniques do not succeed in the unambiguous determination of the chemical structure of unknown compounds. To validate the usefulness of scanning probe microscopy as an adjunct to the other tools available for organic structure analysis, we used the natural product cephalandole A, which had previously been misassigned, and later corrected. Our results, corroborated by density functional theory, demonstrate that direct imaging of an organic compound with atomic-resolution force microscopy facilitates the accurate determination of its chemical structure. We anticipate that our method may be developed further towards molecular imaging with chemical sensitivity, and will become generally useful in solving certain classes of natural product structures.

@abstract:
 The process of molecular self-assembly on solid surfaces is essentially one of crystallization in two dimensions, and the structures that result depend on the interplay between intermolecular forces and the interaction between adsorbates and the underlying substrate. Because a single hydrogen bond typically has an energy between 15 and 35 kilojoules per mole, hydrogen bonding can be a strong driver of molecular assembly; this is apparent from the dominant role of hydrogen bonding in nucleic-acid base pairing, as well as in the secondary structure of proteins. Carboxylic acid functional groups, which provide two hydrogen bonds, are particularly promising and reliable in creating and maintaining surface order, and self-assembled monolayers of benzoic acids produce structure that depends on the number and relative placement of carboxylic acid groups. Here we use scanning tunnelling microscopy to study self-assembled monolayers of ferrocenecarboxylic acid (FcCOOH), and find that, rather than producing dimeric or linear structures typical of carboxylic acids, FcCOOH forms highly unusual cyclic hydrogen-bonded pentamers, which combine with simultaneously formed FcCOOH dimers to form two-dimensional quasicrystallites that exhibit local five-fold symmetry and maintain translational and rotational order (without periodicity) for distances of more than 400 {\aa}ngstr{\"{o}}ms.

@abstract:
 NAMD is a parallel molecular dynamics code designed for high-performance simulation of large biomolecular systems. NAMD scales to hundreds of processors on high-end parallel platforms, as well as tens of processors on low-cost commodity clusters, and also runs on individual desktop and laptop computers. NAMD works with AMBER and CHARMM potential functions, parameters, and file formats. This article, directed to novices as well as experts, first introduces concepts and methods used in the NAMD program, describing the classical molecular dynamics force field, equations of motion, and integration methods along with the efficient electrostatics evaluation algorithms employed and temperature and pressure controls used. Features for steering the simulation across barriers and for calculating both alchemical and conformational free energy differences are presented. The motivations for and a roadmap to the internal design of NAMD, implemented in C++ and based on Charm++ parallel objects, are outlined. The factors affecting the serial and parallel performance of a simulation are discussed. Finally, typical NAMD use is illustrated with representative applications to a small, a medium, and a large biomolecular system, highlighting particular features of NAMD, for example, the Tcl scripting language. The article also provides a list of the key features of NAMD and discusses the benefits of combining NAMD with the molecular graphics/sequence analysis software VMD and the grid computing/collaboratory software BioCoRE. NAMD is distributed free of charge with source code at www.ks.uiuc.edu.

@abstract:
 In this paper, an efficient heuristic algorithm for geometry optimization of bimetallic clusters is proposed. The algorithm is mainly composed of three ingredients: the monotonic basin-hopping method with guided perturbation (MBH-GP), surface optimization method, and iterated local search (ILS) method, where MBH-GP and surface optimization method are used to optimize the geometric structure of a cluster, and the ILS method is used to search the optimal homotop for a fixed geometric structure. The proposed method is applied to Cu(38-n)Au(n) (0 ≤ n ≤ 38), Ag(55-n)Au(n) (0 ≤ n ≤ 55), and Cu(55-n)Au(n) (0 ≤ n ≤ 55) clusters modeled by the many-body Gupta potential. Comparison with the results reported in the literature indicates that the present method is highly efficient and a number of new putative global minima missed in the previous papers are found. The present method should be a promising tool for the theoretical determination of ground-state structure of bimetallic clusters. Additionally, some key elements and properties of the present method are also analyzed.

@abstract:
 The semiconductor industry has seen a remarkable miniaturization trend, driven by many scientific and technological innovations. But if this trend is to continue, and provide ever faster and cheaper computers, the size of microelectronic circuit components will soon need to reach the scale of atoms or molecules--a goal that will require conceptually new device structures. The idea that a few molecules, or even a single molecule, could be embedded between electrodes and perform the basic functions of digital electronics--rectification, amplification and storage--was first put forward in the mid-1970s. The concept is now realized for individual components, but the economic fabrication of complete circuits at the molecular level remains challenging because of the difficulty of connecting molecules to one another. A possible solution to this problem is 'mono-molecular' electronics, in which a single molecule will integrate the elementary functions and interconnections required for computation.

@abstract:
 Neural networks provide an efficient, general interpolation method for nonlinear functions of several variables. This paper describes the use of feed‐forward neural networks to model global properties of potential energy surfaces from information available at a limited number of configurations. As an initial demonstration of the method, several fits are made to data derived from an empirical potential model of CO adsorbed on Ni(111). The data are error‐free and geometries are selected from uniform grids of two and three dimensions. The neural networkmodel predicts the potential to within a few hundredths of a kcal/mole at arbitrary geometries. The accuracy and efficiency of the neural network in practical calculations are demonstrated in quantum transition state theory rate calculations for surfacediffusion of CO/Ni(111) using a Monte Carlo/path integral method. The network model is much faster to evaluate than the original potential from which it is derived. As a more complex test of the method, the interaction potential of H2 with the Si(100)‐2×1 surface is determined as a function of 12 degrees of freedom from energies calculated with the local density functional method at 750 geometries. The training examples are not uniformly spaced and they depend weakly on variables not included in the fit. The neural net model predicts the potential at geometries outside the training set with a mean absolute deviation of 2.1 kcal/mole.

@abstract:
 Theoretical design of global optimization algorithms can profitably utilize recent statistical mechanical treatments of potential energy surfaces (PES's). Here we analyze a particular method to explain its success in locating global minima on surfaces with a multiple-funnel structure, where trapping in local minima with different morphologies is expected. We find that a key factor in overcoming trapping is the transformation applied to the PES which broadens the thermodynamic transitions. The global minimum then has a significant probability of occupation at temperatures where the free energy barriers between funnels are surmountable.

@abstract:
 We demonstrate that using metallic tips for noncontact atomic force microscopy (NC-AFM) imaging at relatively large ({\textgreater}0.5 nm) tip-surface separations provides a reliable method for studying molecules on insulating surfaces with chemical resolution and greatly reduces the complexity of interpreting experimental data. The experimental NC-AFM imaging and theoretical simulations were carried out for the NiO(001) surface as well as adsorbed CO and Co-Salen molecules using Cr-coated Si tips. The experimental results and density functional theory calculations confirm that metallic tips possess a permanent electric dipole moment with its positive end oriented toward the sample. By analyzing the experimental data, we could directly determine the dipole moment of the Cr-coated tip. A model representing the metallic tip as a point dipole is described and shown to produce NC-AFM images of individual CO molecules adsorbed onto NiO(001) in good quantitative agreement with experimental results. Finally, we discuss methods for characterizing the structure of metal-coated tips and the application of these tips to imaging dipoles of large adsorbed molecules.

 Application-specific requirements for future lighting, displays and photovoltaics will include large-area, low-weight and mechanical resilience for dual-purpose uses such as electronic skin, textiles and surface conforming foils. Here we demonstrate polymer-based photovoltaic devices on plastic foil substrates less than 2 $\mu$m thick, with equal power conversion efficiency to their glass-based counterparts. They can reversibly withstand extreme mechanical deformation and have unprecedented solar cell-specific weight. Instead of a single bend, we form a random network of folds within the device area. The processing methods are standard, so the same weight and flexibility should be achievable in light emitting diodes, capacitors and transistors to fully realize ultrathin organic electronics. These ultrathin organic solar cells are over ten times thinner, lighter and more flexible than any other solar cell of any technology to date.

@abstract:
 Iron-based catalysts for the oxygen-reduction reaction in polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells have been poorly competitive with platinum catalysts, in part because they have a comparatively low number of active sites per unit volume. We produced microporous carbon-supported iron-based catalysts with active sites believed to contain iron cations coordinated by pyridinic nitrogen functionalities in the interstices of graphitic sheets within the micropores. We found that the greatest increase in site density was obtained when a mixture of carbon support, phenanthroline, and ferrous acetate was ball-milled and then pyrolyzed twice, first in argon, then in ammonia. The current density of a cathode made with the best iron-based electrocatalyst reported here can equal that of a platinum-based cathode with a loading of 0.4 milligram of platinum per square centimeter at a cell voltage of {\textgreater}/=0.9 volt.

@abstract:
 Physiotherapy practice aims to optimize movement in order to improve functional abilities within peoples' lives. Effective com-munication between patient and therapist is central to achieving these aims. The biopsychosocial model and patient-centred care are two established approaches to health communication and are promoted as frameworks to inform physiotherapy practice. In this chapter, we use empirically derived examples of communication in practice to explore whether and how these approaches are related to communication in physiotherapy. We draw data from two sepa-rate qualitative studies of communicative interactions in primary practice physiotherapy settings. Findings from these two studies demonstrated that physiotherapy clinical communication is struc-tured and physiotherapist-directed, and is adaptive and responsive

@abstract:
 Rayleigh–Taylor (RT) and Richtmyer–Meshkov (RM) instabilities play an important role in a wide range of engineering, geophysical, and astrophysical flows. They represent a triggering event that, in many cases, leads to large-scale turbulent mixing. Much effort has been expended over the past 140 years, beginning with the seminal work of Lord Rayleigh, to predict the evolution of the instabilities and of the instability-induced mixing layers. The objective of Part I of this review is to provide the basic properties of the flow, turbulence, and mixing induced by RT, RM, and Kelvin–Helmholtz (KH) instabilities. Historical efforts to study these instabilities are briefly reviewed, and the significance of these instabilities is discussed for a variety of flows, particularly for astrophysical flows and for the case of inertial confinement fusion. Early experimental efforts are described, and analytical attempts to model the linear, and nonlinear regimes of these mixing layers are examined. These analytical efforts include models for both single-mode and multi-mode initial conditions, as well as multi-scale models to describe the evolution. Comparisons of these models and theories to experimental and simulation studies are then presented. Next, attention is paid to the issue of the influence of stabilizing mechanisms (e.g., viscosity, surface tension, and diffuse interface) on the evolution of these instabilities, as well as the limitations and successes of numerical methods. Efforts to study these instabilities and mixing layers using group-theoretic ideas, as well as more formal notions of turbulence cascade processes during the later stages of the induced mixing layers, are inspected. A key element of the review is the discussion of the late-time self-similar scaling for the RT and RM growth factors, $\alpha$ and $\theta$. These parameters are influenced by the initial conditions and much of the observed variation can be explained by this. In some cases, these instabilities induced flows can transition to turbulence. Both the spatial and temporal criteria to achieve the transition to turbulence have been examined. Finally, a description of the energy-containing scales in the mixing layers, including energy “injection” and cascade processes are presented in greater detail. Part II of this review is designed to provide a much broader and in-depth understanding of this critical area of research (Zhou, 2017. Physics Reports, 723–725, 1–160).

@abstract:
 Oxygen consumption in marine sediments is often coupled to the oxidation of sulphide generated by degradation of organic matter in deeper, oxygen-free layers. Geochemical observations have shown that this coupling can be mediated by electric currents carried by unidentified electron transporters across centimetre-wide zones. Here we present evidence that the native conductors are long, filamentous bacteria. They abounded in sediment zones with electric currents and along their length they contained strings with distinct properties in accordance with a function as electron transporters. Living, electrical cables add a new dimension to the understanding of interactions in nature and may find use in technology development.

 We show that the different bond orders of individual carbon-carbon bonds in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and fullerenes can be distinguished by noncontact atomic force microscopy (AFM) with a carbon monoxide (CO)-functionalized tip. We found two different contrast mechanisms, which were corroborated by density functional theory calculations: The greater electron density in bonds of higher bond order led to a stronger Pauli repulsion, which enhanced the brightness of these bonds in high-resolution AFM images. The apparent bond length in the AFM images decreased with increasing bond order because of tilting of the CO molecule at the tip apex.

@abstract:
 Using electron-energy-loss spectroscopy, we have measured preferential adsorption of molecular hydrogen at Cu and Au adatoms deposited on a cold Cu(100) surface. We show, with particular attention to the D(2)-Au system, that the molecules adsorb at the adatoms, with an enhanced binding energy. The adsorption state is not of chemisorption character, the D(2) rotational and internal vibrational transition energies are close to the corresponding gas phase values, a characteristic property of a physisorbed state. A revealing signature of the D(2)-Au interaction is an induced dipole activity of the rotational transition, which discriminates molecules adsorbed at the adatoms from those adsorbed on the bare substrate surface. The average number of molecules per Au atom depends on the Au coverage and increases at lower coverages, for example, at 4{\%} of an adatom monolayer, there are approximately six D(2) molecules per Au adatom. In this limit, Au monomers prevail, and a cluster of six D(2) around a single Au adatom appears to be an optimal dense two-dimensional configuration.

@abstract:
 Deep learning has the potential to revolutionize quantum chemistry as it is ideally suited to learn representations for structured data and speed up the exploration of chemical space. While convolutional neural networks have proven to be the first choice for images, audio and video data, the atoms in molecules are not restricted to a grid. Instead, their precise locations contain essential physical information, that would get lost if discretized. Thus, we propose to use continuous-filter convolutional layers to be able to model local correlations without requiring the data to lie on a grid. We apply those layers in SchNet: a novel deep learning architecture modeling quantum interactions in molecules. We obtain a joint model for the total energy and interatomic forces that follows fundamental quantum-chemical principles. This includes rotationally invariant energy predictions and a smooth, differentiable potential energy surface. Our architecture achieves state-of-the-art performance for benchmarks of equilibrium molecules and molecular dynamics trajectories. Finally, we introduce a more challenging benchmark with chemical and structural variations that suggests the path for further work.

@abstract:
 The thermodynamic driving force in the folding of a class of oligorotaxanes is elucidated by means of molecular dynamics simulations of equilibrium isometric single-molecule force spectroscopy by atomic force microscopy experiments. The oligorotaxanes consist of cyclobis(paraquat-p-phenylene) rings threaded onto an oligomer of 1,5-dioxynaphthalenes linked by polyethers. The simulations are performed in a high dielectric medium using MM3 as the force field. The resulting force versus extension isotherms show a mechanically unstable region in which the molecule unfolds and, for selected extensions, blinks in the force measurements between a high-force and a low-force regime. From the force versus extension data the molecular potential of mean force is reconstructed using the weighted histogram analysis method and decomposed into energetic and entropic contributions. The simulations indicate that the folding of the oligorotaxanes is energetically favored but entropically penalized, with the energetic contributions overcoming the entropy penalty and effectively driving the folding. In addition, an analogy between the single-molecule folding/unfolding events driven by the atomic force microscope (AFM) tip and the thermodynamic theory of first-order phase transitions is discussed. General conditions (on the molecule and the AFM cantilever) for the emergence of mechanical instabilities and blinks in the force measurements in equilibrium isometric pulling experiments are also presented. In particular, it is shown that the mechanical stability properties observed during the extension are intimately related to the fluctuations in the force measurements.

 The analysis of atom-to-atom and/or residue-to-residue contacts remains a favoured mode of analysing the molecular packing in crystals. In this contribution, additional tools are highlighted as methods for analysis in order to complement the `crystallographer's tool', PLATON [Spek (2009). Acta Cryst . D 65 , 148–155]. Thus, a brief outline of the procedures and what can be learned by using Crystal Explorer [Spackman {\&} Jayatilaka (2009). CrystEngComm 11 , 19–23] is presented. Attention is then directed towards evaluating the nature, i.e . attractive/weakly attractive/repulsive, of specific contacts employing NCIPLOT [Johnson et al. (2010). J. Am. Chem.

All the mentioned programs are free of charge and straightforward to use. More importantly, they complement each other to give a more complete picture of how molecules assemble in molecular crystals.

@abstract:
 A local optimization method based on Bayesian Gaussian processes is developed and applied to atomic structures. The method is applied to a variety of systems including molecules, clusters, bulk materials, and molecules at surfaces. The approach is seen to compare favorably to standard optimization algorithms like the conjugate gradient or Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno in all cases. The method relies on prediction of surrogate potential energy surfaces, which are fast to optimize, and which are gradually improved as the calculation proceeds. The method includes a few hyperparameters, the optimization of which may lead to further improvements of the computational speed.

@abstract:
 Algorithmic improvements of the dimer method [G. Henkelman and H. Jonsson, J. Chem. Phys. 111, 7010 (1999)] are described in this paper. Using the limited memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (L-BFGS) optimizer for the dimer translation greatly improves the convergence compared to the previously used conjugate gradient algorithm. It also saves one energy and gradient calculation per dimer iteration. Extrapolation of the gradient during repeated dimer rotations reduces the computational cost to one gradient calculation per dimer rotation. The L-BFGS algorithm also improves convergence of the rotation. Thus, three to four energy and gradient evaluations are needed per iteration at the beginning of a transition state search, while only two are required close to convergence. Moreover, we apply the dimer method in internal coordinates to reduce coupling between the degrees of freedom. Weighting the coordinates can be used to apply chemical knowledge about the system and restrict the transition state search to only part of the system while minimizing the remainder. These improvements led to an efficient method for the location of transition states without the need to calculate the Hessian. Thus, it is especially useful in large systems with expensive gradient evaluations.

@abstract:
 Using density functional theory (DFT) and the information-theoretic approach (ITA) quantities to appreciate the energetics and properties of biopolymers is still an unaccomplished and ongoing task. To this end, we studied the building blocks of nucleic acid base pairs and small peptides. For base pairs, we have dissected the relative importance of energetic components by using two energy partition schemes in DFT. Our results convincingly show that the exchange-correlation effect predominantly governs the molecular stability of base pairs while the electrostatic potential plays a minor but indispensable role, and the steric effect is trivial. Furthermore, we have revealed that simple density-based ITA functions are in good relationships with molecular polarizabilities for a series of 30 hydrogen-bonded base pairs and all 20 natural $\alpha$-amino acids, 400 dipeptides, and 8000 tripeptides. Based on these lines, one can easily predict the molecular polarizabilities of larger peptides, even proteins as long as the total molecular wavefunction is available, rather than solving the computationally demanding coupled-perturbed Hartree–Fock (CPHF) equation or its DFT counterpart coupled-perturbed Kohn–Sham (CPKS) equation.

@abstract:
 The automatic generation of natural internal coordinates is extended to all cases except multiply fused ring systems, i.e., ''cages.'' This is achieved by a relatively simple code; most of the geometrical cases can now be treated by a single subroutine. To handle molecules containing cages we combine the natural internal coordinates with the delocalized coordinates of Baker, Kessi, and Delley. We have also modified the delocalized coordinates to separate modes with strongly different force constants. The new methods show very good convergence properties in geometry optimizations. Our test set of molecules covers a wide range of atoms and of different bonding situations. For such molecules good internal coordinates are particularly important because no reliable initial force constant matrix can be obtained to accelerate convergence.

@abstract:
 A detailed implementation of the Tabu search (TS) algorithm for computer-aided molecular design (CAMD) of transition metal catalysts is presented in this paper. Previous CAMD research has applied deterministic methods or genetic algorithms to the solution of the optimization problems which arise from the search for a molecule satisfying a set of property targets. In this work, properties are estimated using correlations based on connectivity indices, which allows the TS algorithm to use several novel operators to generate neighbors, such as swap and move, which would have no effect with a traditional group contribution-based approach. In addition, the formulation of the neighbor generation process guarantees that molecular valency and connectivity constraints are met, resulting in a complete molecular structure. Results on two case studies using TS are compared with a deterministic approach and show that TS is able to provide a list of good candidate molecules while using a much smaller amount of computation time.

@abstract:
 We present results from new experiments to study the dynamics of radiative shocks, reverse shocks and radiative precursors. Laser ablation of a solid piston by the Orion high-power laser at AWE Aldermaston UK was used to drive radiative shocks into a gas cell initially pressurised between {\$}0.1{\$} and {\$}1.0 \backslash bar{\$} with different noble gases. Shocks propagated at {\{}{\$}80 \backslashpm 10 \backslash km/s{\$}{\}} and experienced strong radiative cooling resulting in post-shock compressions of {\{} {\$}\backslashtimes 25 \backslashpm 2{\$}{\}}. A combination of X-ray backlighting, optical self-emission streak imaging and interferometry (multi-frame and streak imaging) were used to simultaneously study both the shock front and the radiative precursor. These experiments present a new configuration to produce counter-propagating radiative shocks, allowing for the study of reverse shocks and providing a unique platform for numerical validation. In addition, the radiative shocks were able to expand freely into a large gas volume without being confined by the walls of the gas cell. This allows for 3-D effects of the shocks to be studied which, in principle, could lead to a more direct comparison to astrophysical phenomena. By maintaining a constant mass density between different gas fills the shocks evolved with similar hydrodynamics but the radiative precursor was found to extend significantly further in higher atomic number gases ({\$}\backslashsim{\$}{\$}4{\$} times further in xenon than neon). Finally, 1-D and 2-D radiative-hydrodynamic simulations are presented showing good agreement with the experimental data.

 Standard density functionals without van der Waals interactions yield an unsatisfactory description of ice phases, specifically, high density phases occurring under pressure are too unstable compared to the common low density phase Ih observed at ambient conditions. Although the description is improved by using functionals that include van der Waals interactions, the errors in relative volumes remain sizable. Here we assess the random phase approximation (RPA) for the correlation energy and compare our results to experimental data as well as diffusion Monte Carlo data for ice. The RPA yields a very balanced description for all considered phases, approaching the accuracy of diffusion Monte Carlo in relative energies and volumes. This opens a route towards a concise description of molecular water phases on surfaces and in cavities.

 A scanning tunneling microscope (STM) has been equipped with a nanoscale force sensor and signal transducer composed of a single D2 molecule that is confined in the STM junction. The uncalibrated sensor is used to obtain ultra-high geometric image resolution of a complex organic molecule adsorbed on a noble metal surface. By means of conductance-distance spectroscopy and corresponding density functional calculations the mechanism of the sensor/transducer is identified. It probes the short-range Pauli repulsion and converts this signal into variations of the junction conductance.

@abstract:
 To investigate the initial chemical events associated with high-temperature gas-phase oxidation of hydrocarbons, we have expanded the ReaxFF reactive force field training set to include additional transition states and chemical reactivity of systems relevant to these reactions and optimized the force field parameters against a quantum mechanics (QM)-based training set. To validate the ReaxFF potential obtained after parameter optimization, we performed a range of NVT-MD simulations on various hydrocarbon/O2 systems. From simulations on methane/O2, o-xylene/O2, propene/O2, and benzene/O2 mixtures, we found that ReaxFF obtains the correct reactivity trend (propene {\textgreater} o-xylene {\textgreater} methane {\textgreater} benzene), following the trend in the C-H bond strength in these hydrocarbons. We also tracked in detail the reactions during a complete oxidation of isolated methane, propene, and o-xylene to a CO/CO2/H2O mixture and found that the pathways predicted by ReaxFF are in agreement with chemical intuition and our QM results. We observed that the predominant initiation reaction for oxidation of methane, propene, and o-xylene under fuel lean conditions involved hydrogen abstraction of the methyl hydrogen by molecular oxygen forming hydroperoxyl and hydrocarbon radical species. While under fuel rich conditions with a mixture of these hydrocarbons, we observed different chemistry compared with the oxidation of isolated hydrocarbons including a change in the type of initiation reactions, which involved both decomposition of the hydrocarbon or attack by other radicals in the system. Since ReaxFF is capable of simulating complicated reaction pathways without any preconditioning, we believe that atomistic modeling with ReaxFF provides a useful method for determining the initial events of oxidation of hydrocarbons under extreme conditions and can enhance existing combustion models.

@abstract:
 We present a numerical model that allows us to study the response of an oscillating probe in electrostatic force spectroscopy to charge switching in quantum dots at various time scales. The model provides more insight into the behavior of frequency shift and dissipated energy under different scanning conditions when measuring a temporarily charged quantum dot on a surface. Namely, we analyze the dependence of the frequency shift, the dissipated energy, and their fluctuations on the resonance frequency of the tip and on the electron tunneling rates across the tip-quantum dot and quantum dot-sample junctions. We discuss two complementary approaches to simulating the charge dynamics, a stochastic and a deterministic one. In addition, we derive analytic formulas valid for small amplitudes, describing relations between the frequency shift, dissipated energy, and the characteristic rates driving the charging and discharging processes.

@abstract:
 A potential end-point in the miniaturization of electronic devices lies in the field of molecular electronics, where molecules perform the function of single components. To date, hydrogen tautomerism in unimolecular switches has been restricted to the central macrocycle of porphyrin-type molecules. The present work reveals how H-tautomerism is the mechanism for switching in substituted quinone derivatives, a novel class of molecules with a different chemical structure. We hence reveal that the previous restrictions applying to tautomeric molecular switches bound to a surface are not valid in general. The activation energy of switching in a prototypical quinone derivative is determined using inelastic electron tunneling. Through computational modeling, we show that the mechanism underlying this process is tautomerization of protons belonging to two amino groups. This switching property is retained upon functionalization by the addition of side groups, meaning that the switch can be chemically modified to fit specific applications.

@url:      http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.0391 http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.00391
@abstract:
 Starting from the working hypothesis that both physics and the corresponding mathematics and in particular geometry have to be described by means of discrete concepts on the Planck-scale, one of the many problems one has to face in this enterprise is to find the discrete protoforms of the building blocks of our ordinary continuum physics and mathematics living on a smooth background, and perhaps more importantly find a way how this continuum limit emerges from the mentioned discrete structure. We model this underlying substratum as a structurally dynamic cellular network (basically a generalisation of a cellular automaton). We regard these continuum concepts and continuum spacetime in particular as being emergent, coarse-grained and derived relative to this underlying erratic and disordered microscopic substratum, which we would like to call quantum geometry and which is expected to play by quite different rules, namely generalized cellular automaton rules. A central role in our analysis is played by a geometric renormalization group which creates (among other things) a kind of sparse translocal network of correlations between the points in classical continuous space-time and underlies, in our view, such mysterious phenomena as holography and the black hole entropy-area law. The same point of view holds for quantum theory which we also regard as a low-energy, coarse-grained continuum theory, being emergent from something more fundamental. In this paper we review our approach and compare it to the quantum graphity framework.

@abstract:
 In recent years, quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) methods have become an important computational tool for the study of chemical reactions and other processes in biomolecular systems. In the QM/MM technique, the active region is described by means of QM calculations, while the remainder of the system is described using a MM approach. Because of the complexity of biomolecules and the desire to achieve converged sampling, it is important that the QM method presents a good balance between accuracy and computational efficiency. Here, we report on the implementation of a QM/MM technique that combines a DFT approach specially designed for the study of complex systems using first-principles molecular dynamics simulations (fireball) with the amber force fields and simulation programs. We also present examples of the application of this QM/MM approach to three representative biomolecular systems: the analysis of the effect of electrostatic embedding in the behavior of a salt bridge between an aspartic acid and a lysine residue, a study of the intermediate states for the triosephosphate isomerase catalyzed conversion of dihydroxyacetone phosphate into glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, and the detailed description, using DFT QM/MM molecular dynamics, of the cleavage of a phosphodiester bond in RNA catalyzed by the enzyme RNase A. {\textcopyright} 2014 American Chemical Society.

@doi:      10.1039/c1cp21332f

@abstract:
 Molecular quantum-dot cellular automata (QCA) is a promising paradigm for realizing molecular electronics. In molecular QCA, binary information is encoded in the distribution of intramolecular charge, and Coulomb interactions between neighboring molecules combine to create long-range correlations in charge distribution that can be exploited for signal transfer and computation. Appropriate mixed-valence species are promising candidates for single-molecule device operation. A complication arises because many mixed-valence compounds are ions and the associated counterions can potentially disrupt the correct flow of information through the circuit. We suggest a self-doping mechanism which incorporates the counterion covalently into the structure of a neutral molecular cell, thus producing a zwitterionic mixed-valence complex. The counterion is located at the geometrical center of the QCA molecule and bound to the working dots via covalent bonds, thus avoiding counterion effects that bias the system toward one binary information state or the other. We investigate the feasibility of using multiply charged anion (MCA) boron clusters, specifically closo-borate dianion, as building blocks. A first principle calculation shows that neutral, bistable, and switchable QCA molecules are possible. The self-doping mechanism is confirmed by molecular orbital analysis, which shows that MCA counterions can be stabilized by the electrostatic interaction between negatively charged counterions and positively charged working dots.

@abstract:
 Theoretical and experimental studies have elucidated the bonding mechanism in hydrogen bonds as an electrostatic interaction, which also exhibits considerable stabilization by charge transfer, polarization, and dispersion interactions. Therefore, these components have been used to rationalize the differences in strength of hydrogen‐bonded systems. A completely new viewpoint is presented, in which the Pauli (steric) repulsion controls the mechanism of hydrogen bonding. Quantum chemical computations on the mismatched DNA base pairs CC and GG (C=cytosine, G=guanine) show that the enhanced stabilization and shorter distance of GG is determined entirely by the difference in the Pauli repulsion, which is significantly less repulsive for GG than for CC. This is the first time that evidence is presented for the Pauli repulsion as decisive factor in relative hydrogen‐bond strengths and lengths.

@abstract:
 The complex band structure of a periodic system is the conventional band structure extended to complex Bloch k vectors. The k vectors with an imaginary part describe spatially decaying wave functions and arise in, for example, the analysis of impurity and surface states. They also represent the quantum tunneling states which are vehicles of electron transport through a barrier such as a thin oxide layer or a molecule. We present a method for obtaining the complex band structure of a molecule which is composed of repeating units. The complex band structures of some simple organic molecules (n-alkanes, alkenes, and linked benzene rings) will be determined and used to analyze electron conduction through molecules (e.g., octanedithiol) connected between gold electrodes. The form of the complex band structure clearly elucidates the molecule length dependence of the tunneling current and also suggests the energy for alignment of the Fermi level.

@abstract:
 Free energy is the key quantity to describe the thermodynamics of biological systems. In this perspective we consider the calculation of free energy, enthalpy and entropy from end-point molecular dynamics simulations. Since the enthalpy may be calculated as the ensemble average over equilibrated simulation snapshots the difficulties related to free energy calculation are ultimately related to the calculation of the entropy of the system and in particular of the solvent entropy. In the last two decades implicit solvent models have been used to circumvent the problem and to take into account solvent entropy implicitly in the solvation terms. More recently outstanding advancement in both implicit solvent models and in entropy calculations are making the goal of free energy estimation from end-point simulations more feasible than ever before. We review briefly the basic theory and discuss the advancements in light of practical applications.

 An analytical formula has been derived for the calculation of the solvent accessible surface area of a protein molecule or equivalently the surface area exterior to an arbitrary number of overlapping spheres. The directional derivative of this function with respect to atomic co-ordinates is provided to facilitate minimization procedures used with molecular docking algorithms and energy calculations. An analytical formula for the calculation of the volume enclosed within the accessible surface, the excluded volume, is also derived. Although the area function is not specific to the structures of proteins, the derivation was motivated by the need for a computationally feasible simulation of the hydrophobic effect in proteins. A computer program using the equations for area has been tested and has had limited application to the docking of protein ??-helices. Possible relationships of the solvent excluded volume to hydrophobic interaction free energy and transfer free energy of solute molecules are derived from the statistical mechanics of solution. ?? 1984.

@abstract:
 It was suggested more than thirty years ago that Watson-Crick base pairing might be used for the rational design of nanometre-scale structures from nucleic acids. Since then, and especially since the introduction of the origami technique, DNA nanotechnology has enabled increasingly more complex structures. But although general approaches for creating DNA origami polygonal meshes and design software are available, there are still important constraints arising from DNA geometry and sense/antisense pairing, necessitating some manual adjustment during the design process. Here we present a general method of folding arbitrary polygonal digital meshes in DNA that readily produces structures that would be very difficult to realize using previous approaches. The design process is highly automated, using a routeing algorithm based on graph theory and a relaxation simulation that traces scaffold strands through the target structures. Moreover, unlike conventional origami designs built from close-packed helices, our structures have a more open conformation with one helix per edge and are therefore stable under the ionic conditions usually used in biological assays.

@abstract:
 In a recent paper, Gregurick, Alexander, and Hartke [S. K. Gregurick, M. H. Alexander, and B. Hartke, J. Chem. Phys. 104, 2684 (1996)] proposed a global geometry optimization technique using a modified Genetic Algorithm approach for clusters. They refer to their technique as a deterministic/stochastic genetic algorithm (DS‐GA). In this technique, the stochastic part is a traditional GA, with the manipulations being carried out on binary‐coded internal coordinates (atom–atom distances). The deterministic aspect of their method is the inclusion of a coarse gradient descent calculation on each geometry. This step avoids spending a large amount of computer time searching parts of the configuration space which correspond to high‐energy geometries. Their tests of the technique show it is vastly more efficient than searches without this local minimization. They report geometries for clusters of up to n=29 Ar atoms, and find that their computer time scales as O(n4.5). In this work, we have recast the genetic algorithm optimization in space‐fixed Cartesian coordinates, which scale much more favorably than internal coordinates for large clusters. We introduce genetic operators suited for real (base‐10) variables. We find convergence for clusters up to n=55. Furthermore, our algorithm scales as O(n3.3). It is concluded that genetic algorithm optimization in nonseparable real variables is not only viable, but numerically superior to that in internal candidates for atomic cluster calculations. Furthermore, no special choice of variable need be made for different cluster types; real Cartesian variables are readily portable, and can be used for atomic and molecular clusters with no extra effort. {\textcopyright} 1996 American Institute of Physics.

@abstract:
 We have performed a density functional study of graphene adsorbed on Au(111) surface using both a local density approximation and a semiempirical van der Waals approach proposed by Grimme, known as the DFT-D2 method. Graphene physisorbed on metal has the linear dispersion preserved in the band-structure, but the Fermi level of the system is shifted with respect to the conical points which results in a doping effect. We show that the type and amount of doping depends not only on the choice of the exchange-correlation functional used in the calculations, but also on the supercell geometry that models the physical system. We analyzed how the factors such as the in-plane cell parameter and interlayer spacing in gold influence the Fermi level shift and we found that even a small variation in these parameters may cause a transition from p-type to n-type doping. We have selected a reasonable set of model parameters and obtained that graphene is either undoped or at most slightly p-type doped on the clean Au(111) surface, which seems to be in line with experimental findings. On the other hand, modifications of the substrate lattice may induce larger doping up to 0.30-0.40 eV depending on the graphene-metal adsorption distance. The sensitivity of the graphene-gold interface to the structural parameters may allow to tune doping across the samples which could lead to possible applications in graphene-based electronic devices. We believe that the present remarks can be also useful for other studies based on the periodic DFT.

 The charge state of a molecule governs its physicochemical properties, such as conformation, reactivity, and aromaticity, with implications for on-surface synthesis, catalysis, photoconversion, and applications in molecular electronics. On insulating, multilayer sodium chloride (NaCl) films, we controlled the charge state of organic molecules and resolved their structures in neutral, cationic, anionic, and dianionic states by atomic force microscopy, obtaining atomic resolution and bond-order discrimination using carbon monoxide (CO)-functionalized tips. We detected changes in conformation, adsorption geometry, and bond-order relations for azobenzene, tetracyanoquinodimethane, and pentacene in multiple charge states. Moreover, for porphine, we investigate the charge state-dependent change of aromaticity and conjugation pathway in the macrocycle. This work opens the way to studying chemical-structural changes of individual molecules for a wide range of charge states.

@abstract:
 The relation between the tunnelling current I(t) and the interaction energy/force E in an atomic-scale contact is discussed in the framework of a theoretical model established here. According to our model, we predict the existence of two characteristic scaling regimes, where the tunnelling current is either proportional to the interaction energy, I(t) {\~{}} E, or to the square of the interaction energy, I(t) {\~{}} E(2). We show that the existence of a given regime is basically controlled by two parameters: (i) the energy degeneracy $\Delta$ and (ii) the hopping t between electronic levels involved in the interaction process. In addition, we discuss the validity of the Bardeen method to determine the tunnelling current in the short tip-sample distances.

A characteristic feature of these dynamics is the presence of a history-dependent potential term that, in time, fills the minima in the FES, allowing the efficient exploration and accurate determination of the FES as a function of the collective coordinates. We demonstrate the usefulness of this approach in the case of the dissociation of a NaCl molecule in water and in the study of the conformational changes of a dialanine in solution.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}

@abstract:
 A careful choice of the surface coverage of iron phthalocyanine (FePc) on Ag (110) around the single monolayer allows us to drive with high precision both the long-range supramolecular arrangement and the local adsorption geometry of FePc molecules on the given surface. We show that this opens up the possibility of sharply switching the catalytic activity of FePc in the oxygen reduction reaction and contextual surface oxidation in a reproducible way. A comprehensive and detailed picture built on diverse experimental evidence from scanning tunnelling microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and X-ray absorption spectroscopy, coupled with density functional theory calculations, sheds new light on the nature of the catalytically active molecule-surface coordination and on the boundary conditions for its occurrence. The results are of relevance for the improvement of the catalytic efficiency of metallo-macrocycles as viable substitutes for platinum in the cathodic compartment of low-temperature fuel cells.

@abstract:
 Copper phthalocyanine (CuPc) is a small molecule often used in organic light emitting diodes where it is deposited on a conducting electrode. Previous scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) studies of CuPc on Cu(111) have shown that inelastic tunneling events can cause CuPc to switch between a ground state and two symmetrically equivalent metastable states in which the molecule is rotated. We investigated CuPc on Cu(111) and Ag(111) with STM and lateral force microscopy (LFM). Even without inelastic events, the presence of the tip can induce rotations and upon closer approach, causes the rotated states to be favored. Combining STM measurements at various temperatures and LFM measurements, we show that the long-range attraction of the tip changes the potential energy landscape of this molecular switch. We can also determine the geometry of the rotated and ground states. We compare our observations of CuPc on Cu(111) to CuPc on Ag(111). On Ag(111), CuPc appears flat and does not rotate. Stronger bonding typically involves shorter bond lengths, larger shifts of energy levels, and structural stability. Although the binding of CuPc to Cu(111) is stronger than that on Ag(111), the nonplanar geometry of CuPc on Cu(111) is accompanied by two metastable states which are not present on the Ag(111) surface. This article has not yet been cited by other publications.

@abstract:
 Molecular self-assembly with DNA offers a route for building user-defined nanoscale objects, but an apparent requirement for magnesium in solution has limited the range of conditions for which practical utility of such objects may be achieved. Here we report conditions for assembling templated multi-layer DNA objects in the presence of monovalent ions, showing that neither divalent cations in general or magnesium in particular are essential ingredients for the successful assembly of such objects. The percentage of DNA strands in an object that do not form thermally stable double-helical DNA domains (T(m){\textgreater}45 °C) with the template molecule correlated with the sodium requirements for obtaining folded objects. Minimizing the fraction of such weakly binding strands by rational design choices enhanced the yield of folding. The results support the view that DNA-based nanodevices may be designed and produced for a variety of target environments.

@abstract:
 Coulomb interactions between electrons lead to the observed multiplet structure and breakdown of the Aufbau principle for atomic d and f shells1. Nevertheless, these effects can disappear in extended systems. For instance, the multiplet structure of atomic carbon is not a feature of graphite or diamond. A quantum dot is an extended system containing 106 atoms for which electron–electron interactions do survive and the interplay between the Coulomb energy, J, and the quantization energy, E, is crucial to Coulomb blockade2, 3, 4, 5. We have discovered consequences of Coulomb interactions in self-assembled quantum dots by interpreting experimental spectra with an atomistic calculation. The Coulomb effects, evident in the photon emission process, are tunable in situ by controlling the quantum dot charge from +6e to -6e. The same dot shows two regimes: JE for electron charging yet JE for hole charging. We find a breakdown of the Aufbau principle for holes; clear proof of non-perturbative hole–hole interactions; promotion–demotion processes in the final state of the emission process, effects first predicted a decade ago6; and pronounced configuration hybridizations in the initial state. The level of charge control and the energy scales result in Coulomb effects with no obvious analogues in atomic physics.

@author:   Asensio, Amparo and Kobko, Nadya and Dannenberg, J. J.
@doi:      10.1021/jp0344646
@abstract:
 The cooperative contributions to the H-bonding interaction energies of the adenine-thymine and guanine-cytosine base pairs have been evaluated using molecular orbital theory. The energies of the individual bonds in each base pair were ascertained by using models structures that keep one H-bond at a time intact by rotating one base with respect to the other about the axis of each H-bond to form structures with the bases perpendicular to each other. The energies of the individual H-bonds calculated in this way are compared with those of the planar base pairs. Optimized geometries were obtained using ab initio molecular orbital theory with electron correlation (MP2/D95**) and density functional theory (B3LYP/D95**). The cooperative contributions are of similar magnitude for each base pair. However, since the A{\textperiodcentered}T overall interaction is weaker, the cooperative interaction provides 31{\%} of its stability versus only 12-16{\%} for G{\textperiodcentered}C. The relatively smaller cooperative contribution to G{\textperiodcentered}C is due to the difficulty of forming three optimal H-bonds between two rigid molecules. Structural modifications that might strengthen one H-bond tend to weaken another. As a result the central H-bond of G{\textperiodcentered}C appears to be compressed by the attractive interaction in the two outer H-bonds. To the extent that these observations can be generalized, they should be important to the design of materials that utilize H-bonding motifs for self-assembly.

 High-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) reveals that the first layer of water on Ru(0001) and also on Pd(111) consists of hexagonal molecular domains of two types, rotated by 30 degrees relative to one another. Pentagon and heptagon clusters bridge the two types of hexagons. One of the orientations is in registry with the substrate. Its molecules lie flat and their O atoms form strong bonds to the metal atoms lying directly below. In the other domain the molecules have dangling H bonds. They are weakly bound to the substrate and lie correspondingly higher. This bonding motif, though nonperiodic, is of similar nature to the periodic wetting structure recently reported on Pt(111), and very different from the conventional "ice-like" bilayer. First-principles density functional theory (DFT) simulations of the STM images support these conclusions.

@abstract:
 A numerical integration rule for multivariate cubic polynomials over n-dimensional simplices was designed by Hammer and Stroud (1956). The quadrature rule requires n + 2 quadrature points: the barycentre of the simplex and n + 1 points that lie on the connecting lines between the barycentre and the vertices of the simplex. In the planar case, this particular rule belongs to a two-parameter family of quadrature rules that admit exact integration of bivariate polynomials of total degree three over triangles. We prove that this rule is exact for a larger space, namely the C1 cubic Clough–Tocher spline space over macro-triangles if and only if the split-point is the barycentre. This results in a factor of three reduction in the number of quadrature points needed to integrate the Clough–Tocher spline space exactly.

@abstract:
 Novelties are part of our daily lives. We constantly adopt new technologies, conceive new ideas, meet new people, experiment with new situations. Occasionally, we as individuals, in a complicated cognitive and sometimes fortuitous process, come up with something that is not only new to us, but to our entire society so that what is a personal novelty can turn into an innovation at a global level. Innovations occur throughout social, biological and technological systems and, though we perceive them as a very natural ingredient of our human experience, little is known about the processes determining their emergence. Still the statistical occurrence of innovations shows striking regularities that represent a starting point to get a deeper insight in the whole phenomenology. This paper represents a small step in that direction, focusing on reviewing the scientific attempts to effectively model the emergence of the new and its regularities, with an emphasis on more recent contributions: from the plain Simon's model tracing back to the 1950s, to the newest model of Polya's urn with triggering of one novelty by another. What seems to be key in the successful modelling schemes proposed so far is the idea of looking at evolution as a path in a complex space, physical, conceptual, biological, technological, whose structure and topology get continuously reshaped and expanded by the occurrence of the new. Mathematically it is very interesting to look at the consequences of the interplay between the "actual" and the "possible" and this is the aim of this short review.

@abstract:
 We study the electronic and transport properties of two novel molecular wires made of atomic chains of carbon atoms (polyynes) capped with either benzene-thiols or pyridines. While both molecules are structurally similar, the electrical conductance of benzene-thiol-capped chains attached to gold electrodes is found to be much higher than that of pyridine-capped chains. We predict that the conductance is almost independent of molecular length, which suggests that these molecules could be ideal molecular wires for sub-10 nm circuitry. Both systems exhibit negative differential resistance (NDR) but its origin and characteristics depend on the type of molecule. We find a novel type of NDR mechanism produced by the movement of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) resonance with bias. We also show that by gating the pyridine-capped molecules it is possible to make the NDR disappear and dramatically modify the I-V characteristics and the length dependence.

@author:   Jussi, H
@abstract:
 This work studies the mathematics of selected techniques for coloring fractal images. The classic escape time algorithm is extended by adding the concepts of coloring, palette and index functions. The coloring function is evaluated for each pixel of an image, whereas palette and index functions map this value to the final RGB color. In addition to good performance, also smoothness and the possibility to adjust the visual appearance are desirable characteristics of coloring functions. The Smooth Iteration Count coloring is the smooth equivalent of the classic Iteration Count coloring. Its continuity and smoothness are studied thoroughly. The Smooth Iteration Count coloring exhibits small discontinuities at the iteration boundaries of a fractal, and a method for calculating an upper bound for the magnitude of the discontinuity is presented. Average colorings are a family of coloring functions that use the decimal part of the smooth iteration count to interpolate between average sums. In addition to linear interpolation, a smooth Catmull-Rom spline interpolation method can be used. The Triangle Inequality Average and Curvature Average colorings are presented and analyzed as examples of branching average colorings. Both colorings exhibit a similar tree-like branching structure, and the three mathematical properties that lead to this kind of structure are presented. A new coloring called the Stripe Average is introduced based on the behavior of the Triangle Inequality Average coloring.

@abstract:
 Organic molecules, such as pharmaceuticals, agro-chemicals and pigments, frequently form several crystal polymorphs with different physicochemical properties. Finding polymorphs has long been a purely experimental game of trial-and-error. Here we utilize in silico polymorph screening in combination with rationally planned crystallization experiments to study the polymorphism of the pharmaceutical compound Dalcetrapib, with 10 torsional degrees of freedom one of the most flexible molecules ever studied computationally. The experimental crystal polymorphs are found at the bottom of the calculated lattice energy landscape, and two predicted structures are identified as candidates for a missing, thermodynamically more stable polymorph. Pressure-dependent stability calculations suggested high pressure as a means to bring these polymorphs into existence. Subsequently, one of them could indeed be crystallized in the 0.02 to 0.50[thinsp]GPa pressure range and was found to be metastable at ambient pressure, effectively derisking the appearance of a more stable polymorph during late-stage development of Dalcetrapib.

 Localization of electronic excitations at molecule-sized semiconductor defects often precedes non-radiative (NR) decay, and it is known that many molecules undergo NR decay via conical intersection.

@abstract:
 Ion hydration and transport at interfaces are relevant to a wide range of applied fields and natural processes 1–5 . Interfacial effects are particularly profound in confined geometries such as nanometre-sized channels 6–8 , where the mechanisms of ion transport in bulk solutions may not apply 9,10 . To correlate atomic structure with the transport properties of hydrated ions, both the interfacial inhomogeneity and the complex competing interactions among ions, water and surfaces require detailed molecular-level characterization. Here we constructed individual sodium ion (Na +) hydrates on a NaCl(001) surface by progressively attaching single water molecules (one to five) to the Na + ion using a combined scanning tunnelling microscopy and noncontact atomic force microscopy system. We found that the Na + ion hydrated with three water molecules diffuses orders of magnitude more quickly than other ion hydrates. Ab initio calculations revealed that such high ion mobility arises from the existence of a metastable state, in which the three water molecules around the Na + ion can rotate collectively with a rather small energy barrier. This scenario would apply even at room temperature according to our classical molecular dynamics simulations. Our work suggests that anomalously high diffusion rates for specific hydration numbers of ions are generally determined by the degree of symmetry match between the hydrates and the surface lattice. Determination of molecular-level details of hydration processes remains a great challenge, both experimentally and theoretically. Various spectroscopic techniques have been used to identify the struc-ture and dynamics of solvated ions or molecules through vibrational fingerprints 11–13 . However, all of these techniques suffer from poor spatial resolution and the difficulty of spectral assignment. Molecular simulations have also become powerful tools with which to investi-gate atomic-scale hydration properties 2,14,15 , but the reliability of the results depends critically on many tunable factors 14 . Recently, scanning probe microscopy has provided an opportunity to probe interfacial water at the single-molecule or even submolecular level 16–22 , but the application to ion hydration systems is not straightforward owing to the lack of controlled methods of preparing individual ion hydrates on the substrates and the high flexibility of their structures 23,24 . Using an ultrahigh-resolution scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) and qPlus 25 noncontact atomic force microscopy (AFM) combined system, here we studied the hydrated Na + ion, an alkali metal ion abundant in natural water and biological solutions. The Na + hydrates (Na + ⋅nD 2 O, n = 1–5) were assembled in a con-trolled manner by progressively attaching single D 2 O molecules to Na + ions, which were extracted from the NaCl surface with a chlorine (Cl)-terminated tip (for detailed procedures, see Methods and Supplementary Fig. 1). We found that the barrier for extracting the Na + from NaCl was greatly suppressed with the assistance of water 26 . Figure 1a–e shows the atomic models, STM/AFM images (acquired with a CO tip 27) and AFM simulations of Na + ⋅nD 2 O clusters (n = 1–5). From the atomically resolved STM images, it can be clearly seen that Na + ⋅D 2 O, Na + ⋅2D 2 O, and Na + ⋅3D 2 O adsorb at the bridge sites, while Na + ⋅4D 2 O and Na + ⋅5D 2 O adsorb on top of the Cl − sites. We found that the maximum number of water molecules in the first hydration shell is five (see Supplementary Fig. 2). Further addition of water to Na + ⋅5D 2 O results in formation of the second and higher hydration shells. The AFM images of the ion hydrates were acquired within the weak-disturbance region where the high-order electrostatic force is dominant 21 , providing higher resolution and finer details than STM. The charge state of Na in the hydrates can be verified by comparing the AFM images and simulations (Supplementary Fig. 3). In the AFM images, the Na + ion appears as a dark depression, mainly arising from the electrostatic attraction between the CO-tip apex and the Na + ion. By contrast, the water molecule was imaged as a bright feature (white arrow in Fig. 1a) surrounded by a dark ring (white dashed curve in Fig. 1a), which are ascribed to the negatively charged O atom and the positively charged D atom, respectively 21 . The 'standing' water (that is, the molecular plane of the water molecule is perpendicular to the surface, in contrast to the flat-lying water molecules) of Na + ⋅3D 2 O (see the white arrow in Fig. 1c) shows a prominent protrusion caused by the Pauli repulsion force. The fuzzy feature in the AFM image of Na + ⋅D 2 O (see the blue arrow in Fig. 1a) may result from the flipping of water over Na + in the presence of the tip (for more experimental evidence, see Supplementary Fig. 4). The AFM simulations based on a molecular mechanics model using a quadrupole tip (Methods) nicely reproduce all the experimental images. The comparison between the submolecular-resolution AFM image and simulation is important in determining the structure of ion hydrates (one example is shown in Supplementary Fig. 5). Next we explored the transport of those hydrates. To activate their diffusion at low temperature (5 K), we used the inelastic electron tunnelling technique by injecting 'hot' (that is, with larger energy than those at the experimental temperature) electrons/holes into the Au substrate, which transport along the surface and transfer their energy to the hydrates 28,29

@abstract:
 It has often been stated that Saturn's magnetosphere and aurorae are intermediate between those of Earth, where the dominant processes are solar wind driven, and those of Jupiter, where processes are driven by a large source of internal plasma. But this view is based on information about Saturn that is far inferior to what is now available. Here we report ultraviolet images of Saturn, which, when combined with simultaneous Cassini measurements of the solar wind and Saturn kilometric radio emission, demonstrate that its aurorae differ morphologically from those of both Earth and Jupiter. Saturn's auroral emissions vary slowly; some features appear in partial corotation whereas others are fixed to the solar wind direction; the auroral oval shifts quickly in latitude; and the aurora is often not centred on the magnetic pole nor closed on itself. In response to a large increase in solar wind dynamic pressure Saturn's aurora brightened dramatically, the brightest auroral emissions moved to higher latitudes, and the dawn side polar regions were filled with intense emissions. The brightening is reminiscent of terrestrial aurorae, but the other two variations are not. Rather than being intermediate between the Earth and Jupiter, Saturn's auroral emissions behave fundamentally differently from those at the other planets.

 The forces governing the contrast in submolecular resolution imaging of molecules with atomic force microscopy (AFM) have recently become a topic of intense debate. Here, we show that the electrostatic force is essential to understand the contrast in atomically resolved AFM images of polar molecules. Specifically, we image strongly polarized molecules with negatively and positively charged tips. A contrast inversion is observed above the polar groups. By taking into account the electrostatic forces between tip and molecule, the observed contrast differences can be reproduced using a molecular mechanics model. In addition, we analyze the height dependence of the various force components contributing to the high-resolution AFM contrast.

@abstract:
 Machine learning advances chemistry and materials science by enabling large-scale exploration of chemical space based on quantum chemical calculations. While these models supply fast and accurate predictions of atomistic chemical properties, they do not explicitly capture the electronic degrees of freedom of a molecule, which limits their applicability for reactive chemistry and chemical analysis. Here we present a deep learning framework for the prediction of the quantum mechanical wavefunction in a local basis of atomic orbitals from which all other ground-state properties can be derived. This approach retains full access to the electronic structure via the wavefunction at force-field-like efficiency and captures quantum mechanics in an analytically differentiable representation. On several examples, we demonstrate that this opens promising avenues to perform inverse design of molecular structures for targeting electronic property optimisation and a clear path towards increased synergy of machine learning and quantum chemistry.

@title:    Orbital origin of the electrical conduction in ferromagnetic atomic-size contacts: Insights from shot noise measurements and theoretical simulations
@author:   Vardimon, R. and Matt, M. and Nielaba, P. and Cuevas, J. C. and Tal, O.
@doi:      10.1103/PhysRevB.93.085439
@abstract:
 With the goal to elucidate the nature of spin-dependent electronic transport in ferromagnetic atomic contacts, we present here a combined experimental and theoretical study of the conductance and shot noise of metallic atomic contacts made of the 3d ferromagnetic materials Fe, Co, and Ni. For comparison, we also present the corresponding results for the noble metal Cu. Conductance and shot noise measurements, performed using a low-temperature break junction setup, show that in these ferromagnetic nanowires: (i) there is no conductance quantization of any kind, (ii) transport is dominated by several partially-open conduction channels, even in the case of single-atom contacts, and (iii) the Fano factor of large contacts saturates to values that clearly differs from those of monovalent (nonmagnetic) metals. We rationalize these observations with the help of a theoretical approach that combines molecular dynamics simulations to describe the junction formation with nonequilibrium Green's function techniques to compute the transport properties within the Landauer-Buettiker framework. Our theoretical approach successfully reproduces all the basic experimental results and it shows that all the observations can be traced back to the fact that the d bands of the minority-spin electrons play a fundamental role in the transport through ferromagnetic atomic-size contacts. These d bands give rise to partially open conduction channels for any contact size, which in turn lead naturally to the different observations described above. Thus, the transport picture for these nanoscale ferromagnetic wires that emerges from the ensemble of our results is clearly at variance with the well established conduction mechanism that governs the transport in macroscopic ferromagnetic wires, where the d bands are responsible for the magnetism but do not take part in the charge flow.

@abstract:
 We address the interplay of adsorption, chemical nature, and self-assembly of uracil on the Ag(111) and Cu(111) surfaces as a function of molecular coverage (0.3 to 1 monolayer) and temperature. We find that both metal surfaces act as templates and the Cu(111) surface acts additionally as a catalyst for the resulting self-assembled structures. With a combination of STM, synchrotron XPS, and NEXAFS studies, we unravel a distinct polymorphism on Cu(111), in stark contrast to what is observed for the case of uracil on the more inert Ag(111) surface. On Ag(111) uracil adsorbs flat and intact and forms close-packed two-dimensional islands. The self-assembly is driven by stable hydrogen-bonded dimers with poor two-dimensional order. On Cu(111) complex structures are observed exhibiting, in addition, a strong annealing temperature dependence. We determine the corresponding structural transformations to be driven by gradual deprotonation of the uracil molecules. Our XPS study reveals unambiguously the tautomeric signature of uracil in the contact layer and on Cu(111) the molecule's deprotonation sites. The metal-mediated deprotonation of uracil and the subsequent electron localization in the molecule determine important biological reactions. Our data show a dependence between molecular coverage and molecule-metal interaction on Cu(111), as the molecules tilt at higher coverages in order to accommodate a higher packing density. After deprotonation of both uracil N atoms, we observe an adsorption geometry that can be understood as coordinative anchoring with a significant charge redistribution in the molecule. DFT calculations are employed to analyze the surface bonding and accurately describe the pertaining electronic structure.

 Chemical doping is one of the most suitable ways of tuning the electronic properties of graphene and a promising candidate for a band gap opening. In this work we report a reliable and tunable method for preparation of high-quality boron and nitrogen co-doped graphene on silicon carbide substrate. We combine experimental (dAFM, STM, XPS, NEXAFS) and theoretical (total energy DFT and simulated STM) studies to analyze the structural, chemical, and electronic properties of the single-atom substitutional dopants in graphene. We show that chemical identification of boron and nitrogen substitutional defects can be achieved in the STM channel due to the quantum interference effect, arising due to the specific electronic structure of nitrogen dopant sites. Chemical reactivity of single boron and nitrogen dopants is analyzed using force-distance spectroscopy by means of dAFM.

@abstract:
 Frequency modulation atomic force microscopy (AFM) allows the chemical structure of planar molecules to be determined with atomic resolution. Typically, these measurements are carried out in constant-height mode using carbon monoxide (CO) terminated tips. Such tips exhibit considerable flexibility, i.e., the CO molecule can bend laterally due to the tip-sample interaction. Using epitaxial graphene as a model system, we demonstrate experimentally that the apparent atomic positions measured by AFM depend on the sample corrugation. Using molecular mechanics simulations, we explain these observations by the interplay of the CO bending and the nonlinear background signal arising from the neighboring atoms. These effects depend nontrivially on the tip-sample distance and limit the achievable accuracy on the bond length determination based on AFM experiments.

@abstract:
 The theory of atoms in molecules is used to examine the nature of anti-hydrogen bond (anti-H bond) interaction. Contrary to what is found in normal hydrogen bond (H bond) complexes, which are characterized by lengthening of the X-H bond and a red shift of its stretching frequency, the anti-H bond leads to a shortening of the X-H bond length and a blue shift of its vibrational frequency. The topological properties of the electron density have been determined for a series of C-H‚‚‚$\pi$ complexes, which exhibit either anti-H bond or normal H bond character, as well as for the complexes C6H5F‚‚‚HCCl3 and C6H6‚‚‚HF, which are representative cases of anti- and normal H bonds. Inspection of the set of topological criteria utilized to characterize conventional H bonds shows no relevant difference in the two classes of H‚‚‚$\pi$ complexes. Analysis of the results suggests that the specific features of the anti-H bond originates from the redistribution of electron density in the C-H bond induced upon complexation, which in turn evidences the different response - dispersion versus electrostatic- of the interacting monomer for stabilizing the complex.

 We report here an approach for predicting charge distributions in molecules for use in molecular dynamics simulations. The input data are experimental atomic ionization potentials, electron affinities, and atomic radii. An atomic chemical potential is constructed by using these quantities plus shielded electrostatic interactions between all charges. Requiring equal chemical potentials leads to equilibrium charges that depend upon geometry. This charge equilibration (QEq) approach leads to charges in excellent agreement with experimental dipole moments and with the atomic charges obtained from the electrostatic potentials of accurate ab initio calculations. QEq can be used to predict charges for any polymer, ceramic, semiconductor, or biological system, allowing extension of molecular dynamics studies to broad classes of new systems. The charges depend upon environment and change during molecular dynamics calculations. We indicate how this approach can also be used to predict infrared intensities, dielectric constants, and other charge-related properties. {\textcopyright} 1991 American Chemical Society.

@abstract:
 A series of hypothetical conjugated structures is defined; the series is called the p-Coronenes and the first four members of it are shown to respect the 'Annulene-Within-an-Annulene' (AWA) model when tested by means of H{\"{u}}ckel-London-Pople-McWeeny (HLPM) $\pi$-electron ring-current and bond-current calculations. The first member of this series, 5-Coronene, is also a member of the regular [r,s]-Coronene series, where it is known as [10,5]-Coronene. It is shown that, as p is varied (with p always odd, and with p {\textgreater} 3) through the values 5, 7, 9, 11, etc., the resulting structures alternate between a '[4n + 2]-Annulene-Within-a-[4m]-Annulene' (if (p- 1) is divisible by 4) and a '[4n]-Annulene-Within-a-[4m + 2]-Annulene' (if (p- 1) is not divisible by 4). It is therefore claimed that the p-Coronenes constitute an ideal series for testing the AWA model. It is also remarked that each member of the p-Coronene series has only four Kekul{\'{e}} structures, and that the 'spokes' or 'transverse' bonds connecting the central [p(p- 3)]-membered ring to the outer [p(p- 1)]-membered periphery always have a Pauling bond-order of zero, ensuring that the outer and inner rings are 'decoupled'; such bonds also bear zero bond-current, by symmetry. It is argued that the former property of these transverse bonds, rather than the latter, determines that the p-Coronenes obey the AWA rule-which is in fact an exception, rather than a 'rule'per se. The paper concludes by explicitly stating our philosophy that a conceptually simple model depending on no subjective (or any other) parameters whatsoever can give intuitive chemical insight for certain systems equal to that available from far-more complex methods such as ab initio calculations-what Coulson once famously called 'primitive patterns of understanding'.

@abstract:
 An increasing number of natural phenomena do not fit into the relatively simple description of diffusion developed by Einstein a century ago AS ALL of us are no doubt aware, this year has been declared "world year of physics" to celebrate the three remarkable breakthroughs made by Albert Einstein in 1905. However, it is not so well known that Einstein's work on Brownian motion – the random motion of tiny particles first observed and investigated by the botanist Robert Brown in 1827 – has been cited more times in the scientific literature than his more famous papers on special relativity and the quantum nature of light. In a series of publications that included his doctoral thesis, Einstein derived an equation for Brownian motion from microscopic principles – a feat that ultimately enabled Jean Perrin and others to prove the existence of atoms (see "Einstein's random walk" Physics World January pp19–22). Einstein was not the only person thinking about this type of problem. The 27 July 1905 issue of Nature contained a letter with the title "The problem of the random walk" by the British statistician Karl Pearson, who was interested in the way that mosquitoes spread malaria, which he showed was described by the well-known diffusion equation. As such, the displacement of a mosquito from its initial position is proportional to the square root of time, and the distribution of the positions of many such "random walkers" starting from the same origin is Gaussian in form. The random walk has since turned out to be intimately linked to Einstein's work on Brownian motion, and has become a major tool for understanding diffusive processes in nature.

@abstract:
 Synthetic polymers exhibit diverse and useful properties and influence most aspects of modern life. Many polymerization methods provide linear or branched macromolecules, frequently with outstanding functional-group tolerance and molecular weight control. In contrast, extending polymerization strategies to two-dimensional periodic structures is in its infancy, and successful examples have emerged only recently through molecular framework, surface science and crystal engineering approaches. In this Review, we describe successful 2D polymerization strategies, as well as seminal research that inspired their development. These methods include the synthesis of 2D covalent organic frameworks as layered crystals and thin films, surface-mediated polymerization of polyfunctional monomers, and solid-state topochemical polymerizations. Early application targets of 2D polymers include gas separation and storage, optoelectronic devices and membranes, each of which might benefit from predictable long-range molecular organization inherent to this macromolecular architecture.

@abstract:
 Although the physics of materials at surfaces and edges has been extensively studied, the movement of individual atoms at an isolated edge has not been directly observed in real time. With a transmission electron aberration-corrected microscope capable of simultaneous atomic spatial resolution and 1-second temporal resolution, we produced movies of the dynamics of carbon atoms at the edge of a hole in a suspended, single atomic layer of graphene. The rearrangement of bonds and beam-induced ejection of carbon atoms are recorded as the hole grows. We investigated the mechanism of edge reconstruction and demonstrated the stability of the "zigzag" edge configuration. This study of an ideal low-dimensional interface, a hole in graphene, exhibits the complex behavior of atoms at a boundary.

@abstract:
 {\textless}p{\textgreater}Accurate potential energy models are necessary for reliable atomistic simulations of chemical phenomena. In the realm of biomolecular modeling, large systems like proteins comprise very many noncovalent interactions (NCIs) that can contribute to the protein's stability and structure. This work presents two high-quality chemical databases of common fragment interactions in biomolecular systems as extracted from high-resolution Protein DataBank crystal structures: 3380 sidechain-sidechain interactions and 100 backbone-backbone interactions that inaugurate the BioFragment Database (BFDb). Absolute interaction energies are generated with a computationally tractable explicitly correlated coupled cluster with perturbative triples [CCSD(T)-F12] “silver standard” (0.05 kcal/mol average error) for NCI that demands only a fraction of the cost of the conventional “gold standard,” CCSD(T) at the complete basis set limit. By sampling extensively from biological environments, BFDb spans the natural diversity of protein NCI motifs and orientations. In addition to supplying a thorough assessment for lower scaling force-field (2), semi-empirical (3), density functional (244), and wavefunction (45) methods (comprising {\&}gt;1M interaction energies), BFDb provides interactive tools for running and manipulating the resulting large datasets and offers a valuable resource for potential energy model development and validation.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}
