### Code optimization**

Your recently generated code does compile and returns correct results for both energy and derivatives. The code is here:

```
{code}
```

Now try to optimize its performance. Some tips how to do it:
* find common sub-expressions and pre-calculate them (store them in temporary local variables)
* use const and constexpr where possible
* use multiplication instead of division. It is often efficient to pre-calculate `1/expr` and use multiplication instead of division.
* avoid using `pow()` for evaluation of integer ( e.g. `pow(x,2)` ). It is often efficient to pre-calculate common powers such as powers like x2=x*x, or use Homer's scheme for evaluation of polynominals
