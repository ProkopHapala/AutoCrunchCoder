# **Generating the First Version of Code**

Now that you understand the equation, please generate the C++ code for the function `eval()`, which evaluate energy and derivatives (froces) of the energy with respect to the dynamical variables DOFs. Use double precission. The function should be in following form:

```cpp
double eval( T x ..., T& dx..., Tp p ){

    return E;
}
```

where `T` is a type of the variable (e.g. `double` or `Vec3d` for 3d vectro). The input argument `T x` is the value of the dynamical variable. The output argument `T& dx` is the output value of the derivative of the energy with respect to the dynamical variable. `Tp p` is the value of the static parameter.


Use following libraries as included header file:
```cpp
{Includes}
```

### Other requirements:

- Include comments explaining each step of the calculation.
- Only output the function code (without markdown or surrounding text).
- Focus on generating a simple, efficient function that can be compiled directly.
