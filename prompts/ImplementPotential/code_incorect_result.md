### Correct the code, incorrect result

Your previously generated code does compile without errors. The code is here:
```
{code}
```

However after running the test we realized that the result is incorrect. In particular the values of energy or derivatives does not match the reference values. 

In particular these are the values for some test points from your code and from the reference:
```
{results}
```

These means that these output values are incorrect => correct the code for their evaluation. Check back the original formulas.
Try to suggest possible sources of problem and reflect on your reasoning.  
```
{incorrect_output_vars}
```

These are correct ( => do not touch the code for their evaluation them):
```
{correct_output_vars}
```

The original formulas are:
```
{formulas}
