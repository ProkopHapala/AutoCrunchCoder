# **Understanding the Equation**

Here is the mathematical formula for evaluation of the energy: 
```
{Equation}
```

Note that scalar quantities start with lowercase letters (e.g. `x`), while vector quantities are denoted by uppercase letters e.g. `R`.

#### Dynamical variables (DOFs) are:
```
{DOFs}
```

#### Static parameters are:
```
{Parameters}
```

#### Constants are:

## Task:

* Analyze this equation and try to understand its physical meaning. 
* Provide a brief description of the physical meaning of each term.
* Identify possible numerical issues, such as division by zero or large numbers,  square root (or rational power) of negative numbers
* Try to identify common sub-expressions or other patterns which can be used to simplify for optimize evaluation of the energy and derivatives by pre-calculating them.
* Identify which variables are scalar and which are vectors (and how many dimensions they have)
