## Taks

* Analyze this equation and try to understand its physical meaning. 
* Provide a brief description of the physical meaning of each term.
* Identify possible numerical issues, such as division by zero or large numbers,  square root (or rational power) of negative numbers
* Try to identify common sub-expressions or other patterns which can be used to simplify for optimize evaluation of the energy and derivatives by pre-calculating them.
* Identify which variables are scalar and which are vectors (and how many dimensions they have)
