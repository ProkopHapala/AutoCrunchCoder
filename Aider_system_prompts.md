# Note on Aider System Prompts

This document was intended to contain Aider's system prompts, but we do not have access to Aider's internal/proprietary system prompts and configurations.

For information about Aider's prompts and configuration:

1. Check [Aider's public GitHub repository](https://github.com/paul-gauthier/aider)
2. Review their official documentation
3. Contact Aider's developers directly

This file serves as a placeholder for documenting our own custom system prompts and configurations as we develop them.
