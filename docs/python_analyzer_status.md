# Python Dependency Graph Analyzer Status

## Overview
The Python Dependency Graph Analyzer is a tool for analyzing Python codebases to track dependencies between functions, methods, and classes. It uses tree-sitter for parsing Python code and builds a comprehensive graph of code relationships.

## Core Components

### TypeCollector
- Main class for traversing Python AST and collecting type information
- Handles parsing and processing of Python source files
- Manages scopes and type registration
- Tracks function calls, method calls, and class field assignments

### TypeRegistry
- Central registry for all discovered types and scopes
- Maps class names to their definitions
- Maintains scope hierarchy
- Supports cross-file type resolution

### Data Models
- `ClassInfo`: Represents Python classes with methods and fields
- `MethodInfo`: Tracks method definitions and their parent classes
- `FunctionInfo`: Stores function definitions and their calls
- `FunctionCall`: Records function/method invocations
- `Scope`: Manages code scope hierarchy (global, class, function, method)
- `Location`: Tracks source code locations

## Current Features

### Class Analysis
- ✅ Basic class definition detection
- ✅ Method tracking within classes
- ✅ Field detection through `self` assignments
- ✅ Support for nested class definitions
- ✅ Cross-file class references

### Function/Method Analysis
- ✅ Function definition tracking
- ✅ Method definition and association with classes
- ✅ Function call detection
- ✅ Method call tracking
- ✅ Support for method calls through `self`

### Scope Management
- ✅ Global scope tracking
- ✅ Class scope handling
- ✅ Function scope tracking
- ✅ Method scope management
- ✅ Nested scope support

### Cross-File Analysis
- ✅ Support for analyzing multiple files
- ✅ Basic import handling
- ✅ Cross-file type resolution
- ✅ Maintaining global type registry

## Test Coverage
- ✅ Basic function definitions
- ✅ Basic class definitions
- ✅ Function call tracking
- ✅ Method call tracking
- ✅ Cross-file dependencies

## Future Improvements

### Planned Features

### Technical Debt
1. Tree-sitter Integration
   - Update to new tree-sitter bindings
   - Handle deprecated API warnings
   - Improve error handling

2. Performance Optimization
   - Lazy loading of file contents
   - Caching of parsed ASTs
   - Incremental updates
   - Memory usage optimization

3. Code Organization
   - Split into smaller modules
   - Improve documentation
   - Add more test cases
   - Add benchmarks

## Known Issues
1. Tree-sitter Warnings
   - Deprecated `Language.build_library` usage
   - Deprecated `Language(path, name)` constructor

2. Limited Support
   - Complex import scenarios
   - Runtime-added attributes
   - Dynamic code execution
   - Meta-programming patterns

## Next Steps
1. Implement import analysis
2. Add inheritance tracking
3. Support type hints
4. Improve error handling
5. Add more test cases
6. Update to new tree-sitter bindings
