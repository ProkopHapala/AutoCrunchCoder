# Python Dependency Graph Analyzer Status

## Overview
The Python Dependency Graph Analyzer is a tool for analyzing Python codebases to track dependencies between functions, methods, and classes. It uses tree-sitter for parsing Python code and builds a comprehensive graph of code relationships.

## Core Components

### TypeCollector
- file: `pyCruncher/python_type_analyzer.py`
- Main class for traversing Python AST and collecting type information
- Handles parsing and processing of Python source files
- Manages scopes and type registration
- Tracks function calls, method calls, and class field assignments

### TypeRegistry
- file: `pyCruncher/python_type_analyzer.py`
- Central registry for all discovered types and scopes
- Maps class names to their definitions
- Maintains scope hierarchy
- Supports cross-file type resolution

### Data Models
- file: `pyCruncher/python_type_analyzer.py`
- `ClassInfo`: Represents Python classes with methods and fields
- `MethodInfo`: Tracks method definitions and their parent classes
- `FunctionInfo`: Stores function definitions and their calls
- `FunctionCall`: Records function/method invocations
- `Scope`: Manages code scope hierarchy (global, class, function, method)
- `Location`: Tracks source code locations

## Test Coverage

### Core Functionality Tests
Located in `tests/test_python_type_analyzer.py`:
- ✅ Basic function definition detection
- ✅ Basic class definition detection
- ✅ Function call tracking
- ✅ Method call tracking
- ✅ Cross-file dependencies

### Import Resolution Tests
Located in `tests/test_python_imports.py`:
- ✅ Basic imports (`import x`)
- ✅ From imports (`from x import y`)
- ✅ Aliased imports (`import x as y`)

### Class Hierarchy Tests
Located in `tests/test_agent_analysis.py`:
- ✅ Base class detection
- ✅ Direct inheritance relationships
- ✅ Multi-level inheritance (through intermediate classes)
- ✅ Import resolution in inheritance

## Technical Implementation

### Development Environment
- Python Version: 3.10.6
- Key Dependencies:
  - tree-sitter
  - pytest
- Tree-sitter Configuration:
  - Python Grammar Path: `/home/prokophapala/SW/vendor/tree-sitter-python`
  - Build Path: `/home/prokophapala/git/AutoCrunchCoder/tests/build/my-languages.so`

### Import Processing
- Implementation: `pyCruncher/python_type_analyzer.py`
- Tests: `tests/test_python_imports.py`
- Tree-sitter AST parsing for accurate code analysis
- Robust node traversal for all import types
- Filename-based import registry
- Support for:
  - Basic imports
  - From imports with multiple names
  - Aliased imports
  - Dotted module names

## Known Limitations
1. Tree-sitter Integration
   - Deprecated `Language.build_library` usage
   - Deprecated `Language(path, name)` constructor

2. Limited Support
   - Complex import scenarios
   - Runtime-added attributes
   - Dynamic code execution
   - Meta-programming patterns

## Next Development Steps
1. Dependency Graph Construction
   - Call stack analysis
   - Circular dependency detection
   - Dead code identification
   - Optional argument tracking

2. Advanced Type Analysis
   - Type hints processing
   - Generic type support
   - Return type tracking
   - Parameter type tracking

3. Advanced Class Features
   - Inheritance tracking
   - Multiple inheritance support
   - Class decorators
   - Class properties

4. Performance Optimization
   - Lazy loading of file contents
   - Caching of parsed ASTs
   - Incremental updates
   - Memory usage optimization

5. Code Organization
   - Split into smaller modules
   - Improve documentation
   - Add more test cases
   - Add benchmarks
